        <h1>Paint Inventory Recording Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Liquid goods</b> in full containers must be recorded based on package size up through the <b>one-gallon size</b>. </p>
        <p>Record sizes over one gallon in number of [Gallons]. For example:<br /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three quarts must be recorded as "3"</li>
            <li>Two five gallon pails must be recorded as "10"</li>
            <li>Large drums must be recorded in the number of gallons (check the weight to ensure that the number of gallons recorded are accurate)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Liquid Goods</b> in <b>partially filled five-gallon pails and drums</b> must be recorded in the nearest full gallons. For example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A half full five gallon pail must be recorded as "3"</li>
            <li>A half full 55 gallon drum must be recorded as "28"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Kits</b> must be recorded in units. Do not record as gallons.</p>
        <p><b>SW manufactured paint products</b> have a manufactured date code on the lid or stenciled on the side of the pail, drum, or carton. The four numbers give you the following information: the first three digits are the day of the year and the last digit represents the year. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2678 = the 267th day of 2018 or September 24, 2018</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All <b>mistints</b> must be counted. Gallons of paint mistinted during the current year (and on hand) must be entered as sales number <b>9999-13205</b> and quarts must be entered as <b>9999-13197</b>. Mistints can be entered through the <b>Hand-Held Scanner (PDT)</b> or at the <b>POS</b>.</p>
