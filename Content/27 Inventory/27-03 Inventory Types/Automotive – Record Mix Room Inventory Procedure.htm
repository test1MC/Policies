        <h1>Automotive – Record Mix Room Inventory Procedure</h1>
        <p><b>Finished mixes</b> should be recorded under the <b>sales number</b> that pertains to the <b>“AI” prefix product number</b> representing the correct <b>CNS</b> suffix/prefix for the formula. (i.e...GCA in a gallon 224-9993 or B7F in a five 228-2234).</p>
        <p>All open containers in the mixing room should be counted to the nearest full unit. If a unit is at least half full, count the item as 1 unit. If the item is less than half full, count the item as “0”.</p>
