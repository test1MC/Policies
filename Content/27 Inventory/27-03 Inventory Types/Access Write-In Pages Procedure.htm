        <p><i>Important Note:</i> You may not include a product on write-in pages simply because a sales number cannot be found or has not been established. Identify these scenarios prior to November 1<sup>st</sup>, so that the sales number can be set up.</p>
        <p>For <b>Automotive Branches</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Currently there are no <b>Automotive product types</b> that require the use of write in pages. If you have an item that you think needs to be included on write-in pages, consult with the <b>Divisional Inventory Contacts</b> (provided in your Inventory Packet). If they determine that the item should be listed as a write-in, they will provide you with an <b>inventoriable class number</b>. Follow the Write-In procedures and ensure that the write-in pages have been completed and entered before closing inventory on November 1<sup>st</sup>.</li>
            <li>You may not include a product on write-in pages simply because a <b>sales number</b> has not been established yet. If a sales number has not been setup for a product, it should be manually counted on November 1, and then forwarded to your <b>Area Sales Manager</b> to include as post inventory <b>Physical Inventory Adjustment form (PIA)</b>.</li>
