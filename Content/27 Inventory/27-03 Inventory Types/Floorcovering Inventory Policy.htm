        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Stores using <b>SOURCE floorcovering software</b> are not required to roll out and measure rolls or cuts for inventory.</li>
            <li><b>Floorcovering inventory</b> is to be complete as follows:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Stores using the <b>SOURCE floorcovering software</b> and <b>roll tags</b> are to use&#160;the <b>floorcovering option</b> for inventory in the system and scan their roll tags for each roll in inventory.</li><li>Stores not using the <b>SOURCE floorcovering software</b> are required to use <b>write-in pages</b>.&#160;The policies in this section do not apply to these locations.</li></ol></li>
            <li><b>Rolled good inventory</b> that is currently out with an installer cannot be counted - these are orders that you have indicated are <b>Ready for Installation</b> in the <b>Work Order</b>.&#160;Tagged rolled inventory in this status will be automatically counted and added into your inventory for you.&#160; You must still count any <b>non-roll inventory</b> out with an installer.</li>
            <li>Stores using the <b>SOURCE floorcovering software</b> should be aware that any current <b>rolled good Asset Value Merchandise [AVM] inventory</b> that has been properly entered into the system must be counted during inventory using the <b>AVM Sales Number</b>.&#160; Make sure that you inventory all <b>asset value merchandise</b> that has been entered into your system. If you do not inventory the Asset Value Merchandise during inventory, the AVM inventory information will be removed from the system.&#160;Scan the tag barcode and verify the information for all AVM inventory during year-end inventory.</li>
