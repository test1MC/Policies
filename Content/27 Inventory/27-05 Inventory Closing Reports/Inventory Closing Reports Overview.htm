        <h1>Inventory Closing Reports Overview</h1>
        <p>The purpose of <b>closing reports</b> is to account for timing differences between the <b>physical count</b> and the <b>book inventory</b> as of the given inventory date. These reports provide the store with an opportunity to identify any unknown discrepancies that would otherwise create inventory shrink or pickup. Generated entries can be deleted or changed. Similarly, omitted entries can be added, if necessary. </p>
        <p>Questions regarding closing reports should be directed to <b>Store Billing</b> (216-566-2297, option 5).</p>
        <p>The following closing reports are accessible through <b>SWeep</b>: </p>
