        <h1>Control Inventory Counting Overview</h1>
        <p>There are several methods available to <b>control inventory counting</b>. Any or all of these methods can be used. When choosing a method, consider the different types of inventory you have and how well the items are organized, labeled (or bar coded), and stored.</p>
        <p>All <b>Sales Number inventory</b> (including book wallcovering awaiting customer pickup) must be <b>counted</b> using one of the following methods:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 9pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> Inventory Control Stickers</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Printed Product List</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Inventory Tags</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the product has been counted it must be <b>recorded</b> by using one of the following items:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 9pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Handheld Scanner (PDT)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Point of Sale Terminal</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Workstation Terminal</li>
        </ul>
