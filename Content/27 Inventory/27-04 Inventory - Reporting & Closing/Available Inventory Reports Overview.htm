                            <li>It will be sorted from the <b>highest dollar variance to the lowest dollar variance</b>. These variances must be researched. If there is an error in your physical count, make any corrections necessary to your physical counts. Make any corrections before you close your inventory. For more information, see Count Errors.</li>
                            <li>If there is an error in your <b>perpetual balance</b>, no adjustment is necessary. Keep in mind that you are reviewing comparisons between the perpetual balance and your physical count. Some of your variances could be caused by an incorrect perpetual balance created by inaccurate receiving or selling, not expensing a mistint, or an inaccurate physical count.</li>
