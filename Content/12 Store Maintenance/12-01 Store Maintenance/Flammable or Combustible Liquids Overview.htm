        <h1>Flammable or Combustible Liquids Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Flammable products ("Class I Liquids")</b> must be stored in closed containers to prevent hazardous vapors from escaping. Do not leave a container of flammable or combustible liquid open, even if it is being used frequently. These containers must always be kept tightly closed between uses. Sherwin-Williams' flammable products are normally marked with a <b>red, diamond-shaped label</b>. Flammable or combustible liquids include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solvents and paint reducers</li>
            <li>Lacquers</li>
            <li>Floor enamels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These materials must be placed <b>away from any heat or electrical power source</b> (such as a furnace or electrical panel) and must be separate from other products whenever possible. Know the location of flammable or combustible liquids and the nearest <b>fire extinguisher</b>.</p>
        <p>Local fire codes dictate how flammable and combustible liquids should be stored:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flammable and combustible liquids must not exceed <b>4 1/2 feet high</b> when stacked on the floor.</li>
            <li>Do not stack <b>drums</b> of flammable and combustible liquids.</li>
            <li>Do not exceed <b>5,000 gallons</b> in any one pile of flammable and combustible liquids.</li>
            <li>Separate piles of flammable and combustible liquids by <b>48-inch aisles</b>.</li>
        </ul>
