        <h1>Trash Containers Overview</h1>
        <p><b>In-store trash containers</b> must be emptied and waste materials removed from the store daily. </p>
        <p><b>Paint trash</b>, such as paint rags and empty paint cans, cannot be kept in the same container as ordinary trash because it is <b>flammable</b>. Put paint trash in an approved, closed metal container labeled <b>Flammable Trash</b>.</p>
        <p>If you are unsure of what container to use, ask the <b>Manager</b>.</p>
