                        <p>A clean, orderly, and well-merchandised store is more attractive to customers and provides a <b>safer working environment</b> for employees. Creating and maintaining a <b>safe store</b> involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying and correcting <b>hazards</b>.</li>
                            <li>Stocking <b>merchandise display</b>s properly.</li>
                            <li>Using <b>electrical equipment</b> safely.</li>
                            <li>Safe handling and cleanup of <b>paint products</b>.</li>
                            <li>Properly using and maintaining <b>store equipment</b>, including <b>motorized vehicles</b>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: Refer to the <b>LiveSafe manual</b> found on the <b>Safety</b> tab on <b>SOURCE</b> and the related <b>START Modules</b> for more information on <b>facility maintenance</b>.</p>

                            <li>Merchandise must be displayed "<b>facing off</b>" on the shelves. This means that items should be placed right up to the edges and corners of each shelf. Even if current stock is low and there is not enough to fill the shelf, place available stock items at the <b>front of the shelf</b>. Any vacant space will then be behind the merchandise, not in front of it. This prevents customers and employees from tearing their clothing or getting cut reaching for items at the back of the display.</li>
