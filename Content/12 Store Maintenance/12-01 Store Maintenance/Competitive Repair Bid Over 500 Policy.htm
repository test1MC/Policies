        <h1>Competitive Repair Bid Over $500 Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li><b>Competitive bids</b> are required for any repair <b>over $500</b> when the repair is not managed by Division Real Estate.</li>
            <li><b>Manager</b> is required to obtain <b>District Manager approval</b> and three viable bids for all repairs over $500.00. </li>
            <li>Written [email] <b>District Manager approval</b> is required if you are not able to obtain three competitive bids.</li>
            <li>All <b>SWeep transaction</b> or other invoices paid by <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> over $500 that are initiated and processed by the store personnel must contain 3 competitive bids. </li>
            <li>Written [email] <b>District Manager approval</b> is required if the initial repair is quoted under $500 (not requiring 3 bids), but at the time of the initial repair additional items needing repair are discovered.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Example: an electrical repair is quoted at $450 but during the repair a breaker is found to be faulty.&#160; The addition $75 charge now make the repair over $500, but it would cost more (additional trip charges) to have others bid the breaker replacement than to just allow the technician on site to complete the repair. </li></ol></li>
            <li>A competitive bid is not required if the <b>Manager</b> contacts <b>Division Real Estate</b> and they are notified of an established arrangement for a specific company to do the kind of repair needed.&#160; <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Example: Sign maintenance, if the division does not pursue additional bids and the repair is handled by an <b>FCA</b>.</li></ol></li>
            <li>In the instance of an emergency, the store has the ability to bypass the three quote process; but, must still inform the <b>District Manager</b> and <b>Stores Services</b> at that time.&#160; </li>
            <li>An example of an <b>Emergency</b> is an event which may cause harm to employees or products outside of someone's normal control.&#160; A good example would be a store having "no heat" and negative temperatures outside.</li>
            <li>For reference, <b>Stores Services</b> supports the stores 24/7/365 with off-hours support and can be reached at 877-470-4615.&#160; Their response time on evenings and weekends is within 1 hour.</li>
