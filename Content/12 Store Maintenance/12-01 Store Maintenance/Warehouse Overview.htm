        <h1>Warehouse Overview</h1>
        <p>Every <b>Sherwin-Williams store</b> has some type of warehouse area to hold an inventory of paint and associated products. Several of these products are hazardous; many are heavy or awkward to handle. All are valuable. For these reasons, <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> must follow strict <b>warehousing procedures</b>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stores that handle large volume mixing, custom blending, or solvent dispensing have special product service rooms or <b>Liquid Storage Rooms</b> designed to meet strict safety or code regulations.</li>
            <li>Keeping the warehouse area of the store neat and clean is very important for safety as this area contains <b>hazardous chemicals</b> and <b>heavy bulk materials</b>. <b>Sherwin-Williams’ employees</b> follow strict warehouse procedures that must be followed by every store employee. For more information, refer to <b>WorkSafe chapters 3 and 6</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Proper storage of materials</b> prevents fire and accident hazards in the warehouse. The warehouse layout has been designed to organize all materials safely. If you see any problems, report them to your <b>immediate supervisor</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two general rules that apply in the warehouse:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Rule</th>
                    <th>Procedure</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>No customers</td>
                    <td>If you see a customer alone in the warehouse, ask if you can help him and assist him out of the area.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No smoking</td>
                    <td>
                        <p>If you see someone smoking, politely tell him that smoking is not allowed in this area. </p>
                        <p><i>Note:</i> Any employee who smokes or permits a customer to smoke anywhere on store property including but not limited to the sales floor, manager office, warehouse, restrooms, and, anywhere where <b>flammable material</b> is stored is subject to <b>immediate termination</b>.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
