        <h1>Leaks &amp; Spills &amp; Hazardous Materials Overview</h1>
        <p>Some products in a paint store are considered <b>hazardous</b> because they may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flammable or combustible.</li>
            <li>Contain a chemical that poses a health risk through ingestion, inhalation, or absorption.</li>
            <li>Contain a chemical that would pose a health or environmental risk if released into the environment.</li>
            <li>Reactive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these products are properly stored in closed containers, they pose no hazard. There is a hazard only when these products must be opened and mixed or transferred, when there is a spill, or when they are stored improperly.</p>
        <p>Maintenance and operating procedures within the stores, both the sales area and the warehouse area, shall minimize <b>leakage</b> and prevent the <b>accidental escape</b> of flammable, combustible and hazardous liquids. In the case of leakage, spillage or release of any liquids on the store's premises, the liquids shall be cleaned up safely and promptly.</p>
