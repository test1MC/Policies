        <h1>Maintenance &amp; Repair of Fixed Asset Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>Stores Managers</b> have an obligation to keep all <b>Fixed Assets</b> and store property in good repair.</li>
            <li>Be sure to understand any store lease requirements (such as <b>HVAC Preventative Maintenance Requirements</b>).&#160; If lease requirements are not properly performed, we could be held responsible for equipment failure that would otherwise be covered by the landlord.</li>
            <li>Should any part of the store or its fixtures be in need of repair, the <b>Store Manager</b> must identify whether the items needing repair are the responsibility of The Sherwin-Williams Company or that of the landlord. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../12-01 Store Maintenance/Confirmation of Responsible Party Policy.htm">Confirmation of Responsible Party Policy</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>The division <b>Real Estate Department</b> can help you determine who is responsible in a given situation.</li>
                <li> If the needed repair is the responsibility of the landlord, this must be communicated to the landlord as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>Any delay on the part of the landlord to respond to a needed repair should be reported to your division <b>Real Estate Department</b> for further action.</li>
                <li>If an asset is damaged in an accident, the store manager must contact <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> to ensure that any and all paperwork is filled out.</li>
                <li>If the repair is the responsibility of Sherwin-Williams the store manager must ensure that the company called in to quote the work is properly licensed and insured.&#160; Any quote should breakout the following details:</li>
            </ol>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
                <li>Is there any charge to diagnose the problem (where applicable)?</li>
                <li>What will be repaired and/or replaced?</li>
                <li>What is the store’s cost for all parts to be replaced?</li>
                <li>Part number and manufacturer should be specified.</li>
                <li>Serial number (where applicable) should be on the final bill.</li>
                <li>What is the warranty on the replaced parts?</li>
                <li>What is the hourly rate for the technician(s) that will complete the repair?</li>
                <li>How many hours will the repair take?</li>
                <li>When can the job be completed?</li>
                <li>What is the total cost of the project?</li>
            </ol>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="6">
                <li>Find the <b>Proposal Review Form</b> in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Search form name or keyword “proposal” in the Form Name field. All available forms containing your search word will appear below in the form description field.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Service and Repair</b> under $500 - <b>Store Managers</b> are authorized to arrange for maintenance and repairs up to $500.00.&#160; Be sure to document the details outlined above.</li>
            <li><b>Service and Repair</b> over $500 (but less than $1000) - <b>The District Manager</b> must approve all service or repairs exceeding $500.&#160; E-mails from <b>DM’s PDA or District office</b> will suffice for approval documentation. 3 bids must be reviewed when a service or repairs will cost more than $500.&#160;It is important to maintain good communication with both the district office and the division <b>Real Estate Department</b> to ensure that all repair approved by a Sherwin-Williams representative are the responsibility of our company (and not that of the landlord). For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../12-01 Store Maintenance/Competitive Repair Bid Over 500 Policy.htm">Competitive Repair Bid Over $500 Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><b>Service and Repair</b> over $1000 - When the <b>Service or Repair</b> will cost more than $1000, the materials being replaced could be capitalized as a fixed asset and would require an <b>FCA</b>.&#160; It is critical to obtain both the district office and division <b>Real Estate Department</b> approvals prior to authorizing the work.&#160;All <b>Services or Repairs</b> over $1000 will require a review of at least three (3) bids.</li>
            <li>The <b>Store Manager</b> is responsible for coordinating the repair of all equipment and exterior signs. However, when experiencing problem with the signage, it is critical that the division <b>Installation Manager</b> or <b>division Engineer</b> be contacted prior to engaging a service provider to diagnose the problem.</li>
            <li>The <b>Store Manager</b> is responsible for coordinating the replacement of <b>Ballasts and Light Bulbs</b>.&#160; Details on these procedures and approved suppliers for lamps and ballasts can be found in the <a href="http://sherlink2.sherwin.com/stores/policy/12.0/html_files/12-01.htm">LIGHTING POLICY</a> section of the policy manual.</li>
