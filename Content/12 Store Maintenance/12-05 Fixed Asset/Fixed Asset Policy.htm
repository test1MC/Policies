        <h1>Fixed Asset Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Any tangible asset, not intended for resale, which has a useful life of less than one year or costs less than $1,000 regardless of the useful life, will be expensed upon acquisition. However, if two or more items costing less than $1,000 each are part of an initial or major installation exceeding $1,000, then these items must be grouped and capitalized together. </li>
            <li>Two or more capital items purchased should not be grouped together to exceed $999 unless such items are part of an initial or major project or part of a single purchase for a number of locations (i.e. a $400 item for every paint store).</li>
            <li>The cost of capital asset and <b>FCA</b> total includes:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Net invoice costs (including any taxes), contract price or deed value</li>
                <li>Installation costs (parts, labor, ands burden*), recording fees, survey costs, title fees, permits, etc.</li>
                <li>Transportation costs</li>
                <li>Certain internal and external engineering/drafting services</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Improvements, which are expenditures which materially enhance the value, change the use, or increase the life expectancy, strength, or capacity of a capital asset as compared to the status of that asset prior to the expenditure,&#160; should be capitalized and require an approved <b>FCA</b>.</li>
            <li>Repairs, which are expenditures that merely maintain a capital asset in an ordinary efficient operating condition, without materially enhancing, changing, or increasing an aspect of that asset from its status prior to the expenditure, should be expensed. </li>
            <li>When expenditures that would normally be classified as repairs are made part of a general plan of reconditioning, improving, or altering the property as a whole, then these expenditures are considered to be improvements, included in an approved <b>FCA</b> and should be capitalized. Refer to the <b>CORPORATE Controller</b> for guidance in determining the proper classification of such expenditures.</li>
            <li>You are required to process an <b>IST</b> to transfer expense merchandise to another store. Process an <b>IBAR</b> to transfer expense merchandise to another cost center other (Rep. or other inside or outside of <b>Stores Group</b>). Installation expense should not be transferred by an <b>IST</b> or <b>IBAR</b>. Contact <b>Fixed Asset Accounting</b> at 216-566-2254 or 216-566-2205 to transfer any installation expense that should be capitalized. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../../07 Merchandise/07-02B2 System IBARs/MMS IBAR Overview.htm">MMS IBAR Overview</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li>You are required to use <b>FactFinder</b> to complete a <b>Transfer Retirement Fixed Asset Report</b> anytime you choose to retire or transfer an asset. <b>District Manager Approval</b> and signature are required on the completed form. </li>
            <li>As long as the asset is still in the store you do not retire freight and tax even if there is a book value of zero. Only retire freight and tax when you are retiring the asset.</li>
