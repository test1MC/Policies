        <h1>Store Blending - Employee Training Overview</h1>
        <p>When blending stores, it is imperative that the employees working in the <b>blended store</b> are familiar with the <b>new product line</b> they will be offering to their customers.&#160; The <b>District Manager</b> will set up some opportunities for blending store employees to familiarize themselves with their <b>new brand</b> and learn about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brand History</li>
            <li>Selling the new brand and making positive comparisons between all brands sold in the <b>blending location</b>. This will prepare employees to offer helpful advice when customers ask how similar products compare between the different brands offered</li>
            <li><b>Core product lines</b> and the important characteristics of the products offered</li>
            <li>Unique product information</li>
            <li>The new brand’s <b>color palette</b> and <b>multi-mission tinting software</b></li>
            <li>The blending store’s new co-branded mission</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on the needs of the district and the details of the blending, other training opportunities may exist.&#160; The <b>Store Manager</b> or <b>Assistant Manager</b> at the <b>closing location</b> may be retained and brought to the <b>blending location</b> as an employee.&#160; This employee brings the following skills to the <b>blended store</b>:&#160; </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge and experience with the <b>new product line</b></li>
            <li>Familiarity with the <b>new customers</b> and their needs&#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another option the <b>District Manager</b> may choose is to staff the <b>closing store</b> with employees from the <b>blending store</b> during the closing period.&#160; This hands-on training will provide these employees a crash course in products, color, and customers at the closing store.&#160; Additionally, the customers will become acquainted with some of the employees they will be doing business with in the future.&#160; </p>
