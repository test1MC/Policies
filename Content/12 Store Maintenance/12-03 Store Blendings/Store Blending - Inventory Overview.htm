        <h1>Store Blending - Inventory Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>closing store</b> is not likely to run a <b>closing promotion</b> on <b>core product</b> remaining in their location.&#160; The <b>District Manager</b> will plan on using an <b>IST</b> to move <b>core product</b> from the <b>closing location</b> to the <b>blending location</b> to help stock the shelves for the <b>new brand</b>.&#160;The <b>District Manager</b> will provide guidance on placing the store's first <b>STAR Order</b> for the new brand of products.&#160; </li>
            <li>Within a week or so after blending, the <b>blending store</b> will want to begin review their <b>Min/Max levels</b> on all products.&#160; New <b>Min/Max values</b> will need to be established for all new products being carried.&#160; If most customers from the closing store have moved to the <b>blending store</b> as their home store location, you may adopt the <b>Min/Max values</b> of the closing store for the <b>new product offerings</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li>Store employees should also review <b>Min/Max</b> values of <b>existing products</b>.&#160; With additional products and customers in the store, buying trends may change.&#160; It may take several ordering cycles for the blending store to establish good <b>Min/Max levels</b>.&#160; During this time, it is strongly recommended that all <b>suggested STAR Orders</b> are very carefully reviewed before release.</li>
