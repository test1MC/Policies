        <h1>Customer Retention (Store Closing) Overview</h1>
        <p>One of the major concerns with any store closing or blending is <b>customer retention</b>.&#160; The <b>closing location</b> will play a major role in reaching out to customers and assuring them that, though their <b>home location</b> is closing, they can and will receive the same products and service they have always enjoyed at their <b>new home store location</b>.&#160; Your <b>District Manager</b> will take several steps to maintain customer relations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requesting a <b>Centralized Invoice Message</b> to print on customer’s monthly statements.&#160; This message will inform customers of the closing and nearby locations, which can continue to serve their needs.</li>
            <li>A message may be requested to print on any <b>POS</b> receipt.&#160; This message, like the <b>Centralized Invoice Message</b>, will notify customers of the closing and nearby locations which can continue to serve their needs.&#160; This message is particularly important in reaching out to <b>DIY customers</b> who may not shop as often and are harder to communicate with directly.</li>
            <li><b>Sales Rep(s)</b> will be asked to personally visit key accounts to discuss the coming changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with the tasks mentioned above, the <b>Store Manager</b> and employees of the closing location will play a key role in the following tasks:</p>
