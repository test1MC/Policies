        <h1>Customer Phone Campaign (Store Closing) Overview</h1>
        <p>Upon receiving the <b>Customer Master File</b>, the <b>District Manager</b> will ask the closing store to communicate the store closing to your customers. All accounts should receive a phone call from the store to notify them of the closing. The <b>District Manager</b> will provide details on the information that should be provided in the conversation with the customer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advise customer of neighboring locations. Customers often build relationships with <b>S-W employees</b> and come to trust their <b>local manager</b> or <b>long-time employee</b> and rely on the service they receive. If any employees are transferring to a new location from the closing one, let the customer know where they can find these employees in the future.</li>
            <li>Ask customer for <b>preferred new home store location</b>. Track this on the <b>Closing Store Worksheet</b>.&#160; This task <b>MUST</b> be completed within the first four weeks of the closing process.&#160; </li>
            <li>If stores are blending, ask customers what products they expect to see in the <b>new blended location</b> to ensure that they will be able to service their customers.&#160; Advise customer of any <b>new product lines</b> or offerings they may see in the <b>blended location</b>.</li>
            <li>Ensure each customer that this change is to improve the high levels of service, tinting, and products to which they are accustomed.</li>
        </ul>
