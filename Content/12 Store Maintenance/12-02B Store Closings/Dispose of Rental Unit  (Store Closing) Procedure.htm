        <h1>Dispose of Rental Unit  (Store Closing) Procedure</h1>
        <p>Two weeks before closing the store, the <b>rental program</b> will be discontinued.&#160; This should allow customers time to return any <b>outstanding units</b> and the store time to process the units for disposition.&#160; The <b>Store Manager</b> should remove any rental units, displays, and signage from store front at this time.&#160; <b>Rental units</b> can be disposed of as soon as the rental program has been discontinued.&#160;&#160; Several options exist for the disposal of rental units:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell Rental Equipment:&#160; The store will need to complete the Gross Profit Worksheet.</li>
            <li>IST Rental Equipment:&#160; The store will need to complete the Gross Profit Worksheet.</li>
            <li>Retirement</li>
