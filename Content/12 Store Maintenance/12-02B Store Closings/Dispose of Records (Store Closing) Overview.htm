        <h1>Dispose of Records (Store Closing)&#160;Overview</h1>
        <p>Be prepared to assist the <b>District Manager</b> in the collection, disposal, and retention of records.&#160; If any store records have been stored off-site, be sure that your <b>District Manager</b> is aware of this and that the records are brought back into the store well before the closing date for review.&#160; Always keep in mind that any records or store document, which is disposed of, must be cross-shredded.&#160; Store paperwork requiring shredding would include unused <b>B-Prefix Purchase Order Forms</b> and <b>Manual POST Forms</b>.&#160; <b>Store Drafts</b> should not be shredded—these must be given to the <b>District Manager</b> for disposal.</p>
        <p>Some records require retention past the closing of a store and may be transferred to the customer’s <b>new store location</b>.&#160; The <b>District Manager</b> may ask store employees to help prepare for the transport of critical customer records by sorting these out and identifying what store they must be shipped to:</p>

            <li>Sales and Use Tax Exemption Forms</li>
