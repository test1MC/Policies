        <h1>Closing Store Worksheet Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>District Manager</b> will request a <b>Customer Master File</b> as soon as the decision to close a store has been made. This report will be key in performing several <b>customer relations tasks</b>:&#160; identifying customers for sales rep visit, phone campaign, mail campaign, follow-up communication. The <b>Customer Master File</b> should also be a working document in the closing process. The closing <b>Store Manager</b> and employees should use the <b>Customer Master File</b> as the basis of information for the <b>Closing Store Worksheet</b> which will be provided by the <b>District Manager</b>. There are three tabs on this worksheet and each will serve a different use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Track <b>new customers</b> added to the system after the report date so that they are not missed in the store conversion. Complete all fields of information.</li>
            <li>When calling customers to inform them of the closing, the <b>District Manager</b> may make the decision to ask the stores where they would like to continue doing business. By providing customers a choice in their new home store, they will be more likely to select a convenient location for their particular needs and will be more likely to continue doing business with <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>. Use the <b>second tab</b> of the workbook to record <b>Customer Accounts</b> and their <b>preferred new home store location</b>.</li>
            <li>Because <b>special orders</b> may sometimes take longer to ship than expected, begin tracking all <b>special orders</b> and <b>deposit amounts</b> <b>four weeks before closing</b>. This will allow the store to easily transfer information to the location identified to handle all <b>open special orders</b> after closing.</li>
        </ul>
