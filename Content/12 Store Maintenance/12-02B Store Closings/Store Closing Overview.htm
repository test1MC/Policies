        <h1>Store Closing Overview</h1>
        <p><b>District Managers</b> are responsible for all tasks and duties associated with the closing of a location or the blending of two locations. There are several tasks, detailed in this chapter, which the <b>District Manager</b> may delegate to the <b>Store Manager</b>.&#160; When the decision is made to close or blend stores, the employees of the <b>closing location</b> will be informed before an official announcement is made to the <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> community at large.&#160; <br /></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>District Manager</b> will be prepared to discuss <b>final dates of business</b> and the <b>closing timeline</b>.&#160; Typically, the goal is to close a location two months from informing the employees.&#160; The location may stay open a week or two longer after the final day of business in order to dispose of inventory, fixed assets, and records and to make the property ready to turn over to the landlord.&#160; </li>
            <li>The <b>District Manager</b> will also be prepared to discuss individual <b>employee futures</b>.&#160; <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> makes every effort to retain talent and high-performers.&#160; Many times, especially when stores are blending, employee(s) may transfer to the <b>blending location</b> or another location.&#160; The <b>District Manager</b> will also be prepared to discuss <b>Separation Benefits</b> with any employee separating from the company.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
