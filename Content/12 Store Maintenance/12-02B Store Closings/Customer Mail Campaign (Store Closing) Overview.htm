        <h1>Customer Mail Campaign (Store Closing) Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>District Manager</b> will ask either the <b>District Coordinator</b> or the <b>Store Manager</b> of the closing location to undertake a <b>mailing campaign</b> to contact all customers one final time regarding the store closing. If a store employee is asked to handle the mailing campaign, the <b>District Manager</b> will draft a letter for their use. If this is handled at the <b>District Office</b>, be sure to ask for a copy of the letter to answer any questions customers may ask pertaining to the letter. The letter customers receive will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>State the <b>store closing date</b> and include other pertinent information such as a <b>date for discontinuation of the rental program</b> or the location at which special order merchandise may be picked up after the closing date.</li>
            <li>List <b>nearby locations</b> that can provide the same products and services.&#160; Note if any employees from the closing store will be staffed at one of these locations.</li>
            <li>Ensure each customer that this change is to improve the high levels of service, tinting, and products to which they are accustomed.</li>
            <li>Thank the customer for their patronage.</li>
        </ul>
