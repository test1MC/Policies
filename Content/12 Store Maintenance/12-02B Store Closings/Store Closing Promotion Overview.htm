        <h1>Store Closing Promotion Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>District Manager</b> will handle most aspects of running the <b>Closing Promotion</b>, from obtaining a <b>closing permit</b>, if required, to ordering <b>POP signage</b> to announce the closing and or relocation of the store, to arranging for advertising and <b>promotional pricing</b>.&#160; A typical closing promotion will begin one month before the last day of business.&#160; Advertisements, with the approval of <b>Division Marketing</b> and <b>HQ Advertising</b>, will begin to run before the promotions.&#160; The recommended promotion schedule is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>30% - Run 3-4 Weeks Before Close</li>
            <li>40% - Run 2 Weeks Before Close</li>
            <li>50% - Run 1 Week Before Close</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is preferred to disperse <b>core product inventory</b> to other stores when possible, especially when blending two locations.&#160; Most closing promotions will focus on moving exotic, end-of-shelf life, and vendor product from the store. Store employees can assist in the closing promotion by notifying customers who may have purchased an exotic or vendor product in the past of the special pricing.&#160; Running a <b>closing promotion</b> when two stores are blending can be simplified. The <b>District Manager</b> will likely use an <b>IST</b> to move all <b>core product</b> remaining in the <b>closing store</b> to the <b>blending store</b> which will need this product. The <b>closing promotion</b> in the <b>closing store</b> should be limited.&#160; Do not plan on running any promotions on <b>core products</b>. Focus on discounting and moving the following:&#160; <b>product lines not being moved to the blending store</b>, <b>vendor products</b>, <b>exotic products</b>, <b>overstock</b>, <b>end-of-life</b>, and <b>mis-tints</b>.</p>
        <p>Be sure that you prominently display any promotion, closing, and/or relocation signage the <b>District Manager</b> provides. When closing the store on the final day of business, be sure to remove all closing and sale signage. Replace these signs with relocation signs and/or signs inviting customers to shop at nearby locations.</p>
