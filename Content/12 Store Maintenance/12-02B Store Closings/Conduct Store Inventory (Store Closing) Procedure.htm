        <h1>Conduct Store Inventory (Store Closing) Procedure</h1>
        <p>Upon announcement of a <b>store closing</b> or <b>blending</b>, store employees must take a complete inventory of the store, following <b>November inventory procedures</b> with regards to counting.&#160; The closing location will <b>NOT</b> receive an <b>inventory packet</b> and is not required to submit any reports or information to <b>Cleveland</b>. The <b>District Manager</b> is to oversee the inventory and to determine the disposition of remaining product.&#160; The purpose of the inventory is to identify exactly what is on hand in the store.&#160; This task will assist in determining the disposition of <b>on-hand inventory</b> and the last <b>STAR Order</b> date for the closing location.&#160; While taking the inventory, consider these options and scenarios when reviewing the following types of products:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <p>If</p>
                    </th>
                    <th>
                        <p>Then</p>
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Floorcovering</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Reverse rolls all merchandise. Priced to sell, there have been no problems moving <b>floorcovering</b> out of our closed stores.&#160; Large pieces should be transferred using the <b>IST Transaction</b> to <b>large floorcovering stores</b>.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Spray Equipment</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><b>Spray Equipment</b> should be sold at regular or promotional prices. Attempts should be made to return units and parts to our vendors rather than double up another store's inventory.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Wallcovering</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Past experience indicates that the most successful method of closing out <b>Wallcovering</b> has been to prepare <b>room lots</b>, based on the available quantities, priced individually and discounted.&#160;&#160; Attempts should be made to return the <b>wallcovering</b> to our vendors rather than double up another store's inventory.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Core GOM</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Product offerings should be reviewed for <b>IST transfer</b> to nearby locations.&#160; This is the most cost-effective method of <b>unsold GOM product disposition</b>.&#160; Other options available are returning product to the <b>DSC</b> via a <b>Store Closing Return</b>.&#160; Remember that <b>GOM product</b> is never to be sold to dealers for resale.&#160; As well, <b>GOM product</b> cannot be set aside to be purchased at a later date nor can <b>S-W</b> unload a shelving unit immediately.&#160;The store, as directed by the <b>District Manager</b>, and in cooperation with <b>Store Operations</b>, should begin to eliminate <b>min/max</b> assignments for slower moving products a few months leading up to the closing date.&#160; The store should gradually order less product leading up to the last few weeks as to dwindle down inventory levels, ordering only highly important product the last few weeks.</p>

                        <p>Identify and segregate products, which can be considered hazardous.&#160; This assessment should include tint (in machine), rags, and cleaning materials requiring proper disposal methods.</p>
