            <li>Eligible individuals may use a company discount to purchase products which will be used by someone other than themselves (e.g., as a gift or donation); provided, however, that the eligible individual does not stand to gain in any way from the transaction or that the eligible individual will not be reimbursed or otherwise compensated for the purchase.</li>
            <li><b>Commercial use</b> of products purchased with a company discount is prohibited.</li>
            <li>Merchandise purchased cannot be for resale. This will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</li>

            <li>Discounts cannot be combined when using a company discount.  In the event that an item has already been discounted, the greater savings between the item discount and the company discount will prevail.</li>

For example: Customer purchases wallcovering ($200), window treatment ($400), and floorcovering ($800). This purchase would qualify for the [over $1000 list price] and an overall gross profit of 15% (Discount does not apply to shipping and tax).</li><li>Special discounts apply to items ordered at the same time. These products do not have to be picked up or installed at the same time. Make sure all invoices and documents are cross-referenced.</li><li>Company discounts do not apply to installation.</li></ol></li>
            <li>When convenient, store personnel will wait on non-employee customers first. Questions about price will be discussed privately with store personnel – away from non-employee customers.</li>
            <li>When employees separate from <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>, they are no longer eligible for the <b>Employee Discount</b> and their extended family members are no longer eligible for the <b>Extended Family Discount</b>.</li>
