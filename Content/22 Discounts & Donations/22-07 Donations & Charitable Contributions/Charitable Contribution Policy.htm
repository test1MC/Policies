        <h1>Charitable Contribution Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>The <b>Charitable Contribution Acknowledgement</b> form must be completed for any cash and/or property contributions made by <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> in order to comply with the requirements of the <b>Internal Revenue Service</b>. </li>
            <li>Contributions are extended only to causes that fulfill a recognized need in communities where the Company operates and benefits both the community and the Company.</li>
            <li>Care must be taken to see that no organization believes the Company has assumed an obligation for continued support. The receipt of an initial gift does not mean continued support.</li>
            <li><b>Donations</b> of cash or merchandise must be included in the store's budget for the year.</li>
            <li>Cash or merchandise donations must not exceed $25.00 (retail value), at a given time, or $100.00 (retail value) total for the year. For a request that is more than the $25.00 (retail value), it must be submitted in writing to the <b>District Manager</b>, who will review it and, if necessary, forward it to the <b>Division</b> for approval.</li>
            <li>No consideration will be given to any verbal solicitation, unless confirmed by a written request that identifies the organization, its purpose, and other pertinent information so a fair evaluation can be made.</li>
            <li>Telephone calls from professional solicitors selling blocks of advance sale tickets and program ads for circuses and variety shows are not approved.</li>
            <li><b>Corporate Headquarters</b> makes the <b>United Way contribution</b> if there are facilities such as a <b>region office</b> or a <b>DSC</b> in the area. If there are no such facilities in the area, the store may donate $10.00 per full-time employee to the <b>United Way campaign</b>.</li>
            <li>Contributions to non-profit organizations that receive <b>United Way</b> funding are not approved, unless the organization has permission from <b>United Way</b> to conduct a fund-raising drive.</li>
            <li>Dues to <b>Chambers of Commerce</b> and service or professional organizations must be classified as a business expense.</li>
            <li>Retain the signed copy of the <b>Charitable Contributions Agreement</b> in a folder titled <b>Charitable Contributions</b>. </li>
            <li>If the store cost is $250 and over, please fax the original copy of the <b>Charitable Contributions Agreement</b> to <b>216-566-2392</b>, or email to <a href="">tara.a.laflamme@sherwin.com</a> or <a href="">cadedo@sherwin.com</a>.&#160; Forms can also be forwarded to: The Sherwin-Williams Company&#160; ATTN: Tax Department: Tara LaFlamme or Craig Dedo PO Box 6027 Cleveland, Ohio 44101-9944</li>
