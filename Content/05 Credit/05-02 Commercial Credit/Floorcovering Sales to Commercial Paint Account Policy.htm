        <h1>Floorcovering Sales to Commercial Paint Account Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section is only for Midwestern Division and South Western Division Paint Stores.</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Floorcovering sales are not to be run on the paint store account for the same property. Running sales to the paint store’s account is a gross policy violation. Using an “unlocked” paint store account to process these sales could cause your termination from the Company.</li>
