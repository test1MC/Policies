        </p>
        <p>The Sherwin-Williams Company has implemented an <b>Identity Theft Prevention Program</b> designed to detect the warning signs or “<strong class="Strong">red flags</strong>” of identity theft in their day-to-day operations, take steps to prevent the crime, and mitigate the damage it inflicts. By identifying red flags in advance, we will be better equipped to spot suspicious patterns when they arise and take steps to prevent a red flag from escalating into a costly episode of identity theft.&#160; The <strong class="Strong">Red Flags Rule</strong> is enforced by the <b>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</b>, the <b>federal bank regulatory agencies</b>, and the <b>National Credit Union Administration</b>. </p>
        <p>To better protect our customer’s personal information and prevent identity thefts from occurring please follow these guidelines when completing these functions:</p>
