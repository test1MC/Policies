        <h1>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) Policy</h1>
        <p>In order to ensure compliance with the <b>FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act)</b>, you must ensure you and your staff adhere to the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Never tell a customer that Sherwin-Williams will not pull a personal credit report.</li>
            <li>Never discuss with a customer whether or not a personal credit report will be used in the credit approval process. As part of our new charge account approval process, sometimes we utilize personal credit reports to help in making a determination whether or not a charge account can be approved.</li>
            <li>Before we order a personal credit report, we are required by the <b>Fair Credit Reporting Act</b> to have prior written approval from the individual(s) applying for the credit account. This approval comes in the form of our credit applications (retail and/or commercial), which must be completed and signed by the individual(s).</li>
            <li>Failure to comply with these policies can expose the Company to unnecessary risk and can result in civil and/or criminal penalties.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: If a customer has specific questions regarding the new account approval process, please contact the <b>Financial Service Center</b>.</p>
