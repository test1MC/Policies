        <h1>Hard Equipment Job Accounts Policy </h1>
        <p>Hard equipment sales are for the purchase of costly items such as spray equipment or scaffolding. Sherwin-Williams makes extended payment plans available for hard equipment purchases. A commercial account customer whose line of credit will not cover the cost of the hard equipment purchase or who wants extended payment terms may qualify for a separate hard equipment job account.&#160; The hard equipment account allows customers to space out their payments over a set period of time. Contact the <b>District Credit Office/Service Center</b> for current available plans. </p>
