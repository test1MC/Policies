            <li>The job account established must be used for all purchases and payments for that job only. Do NOT use a job account for hard equipment purchases.</li>
            <li>A <b>Sherwin-Williams' Joint Check Agreement Form</b> (Joint Check Agreement Form:&#160; W Power of Attorney-Notary/Joint Check Agreement – Canada) must be signed by all parties involved (subcontractor, general contractor, or principal contractor) and witnessed or notarized.
