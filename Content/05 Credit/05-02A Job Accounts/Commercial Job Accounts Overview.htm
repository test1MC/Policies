        <h1>Commercial Job Accounts Overview</h1>
        <p>Commercial accounts can be assigned separate job accounts for specific purchases. The following types of job accounts exist: <b>Paint and Contractor</b>,<b> TRC Rollup</b>, <b>Hard Equipment</b>, and <b>Joint Check</b>.</p>
        <p>It is critical that store employees understand the importance of running invoices against the correct job.&#160; Customers may request that invoices be run against the incorrect job when they are experiencing some type of cash flow problem or credit issue. If there is a collection problem on the job, the following could occur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In reviewing the invoices, the <b>GC</b> or <b>Owner</b> could notice material that is not the right product or color for their job, and they begin to question the accuracy of our accounting.</li>
            <li>The customer’s <b>Financial Service</b> group could file a lien. Filing a lein for an inaccurate amount is both illegal and can result in civil damages that Sherwin-Williams would be required to pay to the <b>GC</b> or <b>Owner</b>. </li>
        </ul>
