        <h1>Commercial Credit Account Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>The customer must complete and sign a <b>Sherwin-Williams' Commercial Credit Application</b>. Only your <b>District Credit Office/Service Center</b> can waive this requirement.</li>
            <li>Never tell a customer a social security number is needed because it will not be used to obtain the personal credit report.</li>
            <li>You are required to check the customer’s current photo I.D. [e.g. driver’s license, government ID, etc.] to verify that signature with the signature on the credit application. </li>
            <li>Never sign a credit application on behalf of a customer.</li>
            <li>Written authorization should be obtained and retained for someone other than the person(s) listed on the application to use the account. Information must be entered on the customer's <b>Price Record Card (Authorized to Buy)</b>, and written authorization is to be part of the credit file. If the purchaser is not listed, ask for identification and contact the owner of the company for authorization. The person picking up the merchandise should print their name above their signature on the charge slip.</li>
            <li>Approved accounts may be used the same day for purchase made at list price.&#160;Special pricing may be added to price record cards for new commercial accounts, twenty-four (24) hours after the account has been opened.</li>
            <li><b>U.S. and Canadian Locations</b>: Once you have successfully faxed the commercial credit application to your <b>Credit Office</b>, make sure that any Social Security Number(s) and/or bank account number(s) have been crossed out and are no longer legible. The application is to be retained on file at your store in a secure location, such as the safe or locked filing cabinet, until you receive email notification that your credit office has received a copy of the application. Upon receipt of this email confirmation, the application must be shredded. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>"The credit application for the <b>Commercial Credit request</b> below has been successfully received by the <b>Credit/Financial Services Office</b>.&#160;Now you are to shred the original application."</li>
                <li>Once you have received the above message in an email, you must shred the original credit application.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Once opened, any changes to an account name must be communicated by the <b>Store Manager/Assistant Manager</b> to the <b>District Credit Office/Service Center</b> to affect the change in the <b>Accounts Receivable System</b>.</li>
        </ol>
