        <h1>Customer Account Classification Overview</h1>
        <p>Customer Account Classification (CAC) Codes are used to classify customers into groups that have the same focus, interests and, who, most likely, would use the same type of Sherwin-Williams products. Sherwin-Williams can focus advertising and promotions to these select groups of customers when they are properly classified.</p>
        <p>For example: CAC #6513 "Residential Building Managers" may offer a ProBuy (special pricing) for such products as Pro-Mar 700, base grade apartment replacement carpet, select wallcovering, and the appropriate associated products related to paint, floorcovering, and wallcovering.&#160;If your residential building account is not coded to CAC #6513, they would receive neither the ProBuy mailing advertising the specials nor the special pricing when purchasing.</p>
