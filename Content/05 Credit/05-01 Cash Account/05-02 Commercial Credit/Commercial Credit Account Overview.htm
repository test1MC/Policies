        <h1>Commercial Credit Account Overview</h1>
        <p>Commercial accounts are available to help our customers meet their professional buying needs. Commercial customers include, but are not limited to, businesses, painters, contractors, churches, schools, builders, property managers and government agencies. This account is intended for <b>business use only</b>.&#160;For more information on the processing of charge transactions, see <MadCap:xref href="../../../08 Point of Sale Transactions/08-01C Form of Payment/Charge Transactions Overview.htm">Charge Transactions Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>As part of our automated new charge account process, sometimes we utilize personal credit reports to help in making a decision whether or not a charge account can be approved immediately. Before we order a personal credit report, though, we are required by the <b>Fair Credit Reporting Act</b> to have prior written approval from the individual(s) applying for the credit account. This approval comes in the form of our credit applications (retail and or commercial), which must be completed and signed by the individual(s).</p>
        <p>Each month a payment is due, the customer will receive a statement itemizing purchases as of the last day of the prior month.&#160;The payment terms of an account specify the amount to be paid and when each payment is due. The standard payment term for commercial accounts is <b>Net 20th</b> of the month following the month of purchase and will show in the system as "120". For example, anything purchased in January would be due for payment on or before the 20th of February.</p>
