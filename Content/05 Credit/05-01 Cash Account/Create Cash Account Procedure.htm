        <h1>Create Cash Account Procedure</h1>
        <p> When creating a cash account, the process MUST be either completed or voided in order for the new account to be accessed immediately.&#160; The new account number will NOT appear in the system until the following day unless a customer lookup to Cleveland is performed, which may take up to fifteen (15) minutes to appear in the search results. For more information on preferred customer enrollment, please see <MadCap:xref href="../../02 Advertising &amp; Visual Merchandising/02-05 Preferred Customer Program/Preferred Customer Program Enrollment Overview.htm">Preferred Customer Program Enrollment Overview</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Note: On occasion, there can be very short periods of time when the mainframe is being rebooted, usually about ten minutes on a Sunday, when a new cash account cannot be created. Use either a <b>Manual POST Form</b> to gather the customer information and process the sale or wait 10 to 15 minutes and try again.</p>

New accounts may be set up with a <b>Volume Class of A-C</b> without limitation. Requests for accounts in the <b>D and E</b> volume class will require <b>District Manager</b> approval.</p>
