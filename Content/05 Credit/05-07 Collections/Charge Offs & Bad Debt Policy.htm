        <h1>Charge Offs &amp; Bad Debt Policy</h1>
        <p>A charge-off is an account's receivable balance that has been removed from the active <b>Store Trial Balance</b> and expensed to the store because collection is doubtful.&#160; Accounts are charged-off as a result of: customer death, bankruptcy, skip, or any other inability to pay.&#160; All charge-off accounts are maintained in the bad debt ledgers at the <b>National Credit Center</b> in Cleveland. The <b>Store Computer System</b> will not allow charge activity to bad debt accounts or deleted accounts. These accounts are not reflected as part of the store's assets.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>All accounts in the 91+ column of the <b>Store Trial Balance</b> will be subject to charge-off monthly. Only the <b>District Credit Office</b> may make exceptions.</li>
            <li>The <b>District Credit Manager</b> informs the store of the accounts which are scheduled to be charged off. Bankrupt and known loss accounts are written off each month.</li>
            <li>No further credit is to be extended to a bad debt account.</li>
            <li>After a payment is received from a bad debt account, the payment will be credited to the individual store that experienced the write-off.&#160; </li>
            <li>Once an account is set for bad debt lockout, no further company charge transaction activity can be performed.</li>
        </ol>
