        <h1>Fraudulent Charges Policy</h1>
        <p>In order to reconcile customer accounts in an efficient and timely manner and to expedite our recovery efforts, follow these procedures when a fraudulent charge to a Sherwin Williams’ charge account is reported.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Anyone who is empowered to process a transaction through the <b>POS</b> must know the importance of verifying the identity of a purchaser as being authorized to charge on that given account, prior to releasing the merchandise.&#160; Merchandise charged by unauthorized purchasers is ultimately expensed to the releasing store.&#160; If you have concerns about the transaction:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Verify <b>Authorized Buyers</b> on the customer’s <b>Price Record Card</b>.</li>
                <li>Ask questions before you release the merchandise.</li>
                <li>Do not hesitate to contact the account holder directly to receive approval to allow the customer to charge using their account.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Police reports should generally be filed AFTER the customer has signed the fraud charge affidavit and only with prior approval of your <b>Division Loss Prevention Director</b>.&#160;Any specific information about the fraudulent charger will aid the police, (i.e. name, address vehicle description, license plate number, phone number, physical description, “used to work for…” etc.). The police offer our best opportunity to recover fraud charge losses.</li>
