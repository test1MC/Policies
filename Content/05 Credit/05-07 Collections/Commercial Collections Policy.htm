        <h1>Commercial Collections Policy</h1>
        <p>The prompt collection of accounts receivable is vital to the profitability and cash flow of the Company. Customers are mailed invoices centrally from headquarters or given copies of sales transactions daily by each store and are mailed a monthly statement from the <b>Stores Group Credit Department</b>.&#160;The majority of collection activity is conducted by <b>District Credit Offices</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Unless approved otherwise by the <b>District Credit Office</b>, customer terms for commercial accounts will be <b>net 20th</b> prox. (i.e.) the payment is due the 20th of the month following purchase.</li>
            <li>DIY accounts are due twenty-five (25) days from statement date, usually falling due between the <b>14th and 17th</b> of the following month.</li>
            <li>If payment is not received within the established terms, the account becomes past due and collection activity begins by the <b>21st</b> of the month.</li>
            <li>It is the responsibility of the <b>Store Manager/Assistant Manager</b> to be certain that no sale is made to an account that is thirty-one (31) to sixty (60) days past due without approval from the <b>District Credit Office</b>.</li>
            <li>If your store is responsible for collection of accounts on or about the 20th working day of the month, the <b>Store Manager</b> and/or <b>Assistant Manager</b> must identify accounts with unpaid balances in the collectable column and beyond. Use the <b>Customer Balance application</b> found under <b>Credit</b> in the <b>SOURCE Operations Portlet</b> of the <b>SOURCE Intranet</b> to determine if an account is over limit or past due.&#160; From the twenty-first through the end of the month, a telephone call or personal visit should be made to the customer in an attempt to collect the debt. During the first ten days of the new month continue to call on past due accounts.</li>
            <li>Accounts are subject to be written off to bad debt monthly, when any portion of the balance is ninety-one (91) or more days past due. Bankrupt and other known loss accounts are written off in the month they are identified.</li>
            <li>To avoid a bad debt write-off expense, the account must be exempted by the <b>District Credit Office</b> prior to the close of the month in which any portion of the balance is in the 91+ columns. It is important to note that the <b>District Credit Manager</b> can accelerate the entire collection process, including bad debt write off.</li>
            <li>Any bad debt account loss is charged to the store's <b>Profit and Loss</b>. If collected, a percentage of the balance will be levied for collection agency handling (typically 20% to 30%). The <b>District Credit Office</b> may elect to accelerate the actual write-off before the balance reaches the 91+ column for stores responsible for collection of accounts.</li>
            <li>Your store will be charged 1% interest per month on receivables expense for any outstanding receivable associated with sales from your store.</li>
