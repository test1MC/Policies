        <h1>Visiting Customer Overview</h1>
        <p>When a cash or charge account is opened, it is assigned to a home store. The home store is responsible for sales and account maintenance including: <b>Credit, Collections, and Pricing</b>. Customers may use their Sherwin-Williams charge account at most Sherwin-Williams locations: <b>SW Paint Stores, SW Automotive, Duron, MAB</b>. A visiting customer is any charge or cash account that shops at your store, but is assigned to another store. Information on the price record cards created at a customer’s home store is automatically shared with all stores. Shared information includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Customer Information</b> (name, address, email, etc.)</li>
            <li><b>Pricing Flags</b> (ProBuy, Store Special, etc.)</li>
            <li><b>Tax Exception Information</b> - Stores using the Tax Record Card System may view Tax Exception Information on the Price Record Card; however, this field is disabled from prompting the exception during COE or the sale.&#160; A Tax Record Card MUST be created in order to run a tax-exempt sale.</li>
            <li><b>Pricing Rules and Exceptions</b>&#160; (only if within the same Division) </li>
            <li><b>Comments </b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Authorized Buyer Information</b> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In regards to visiting customer account activity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any account downloaded to your system (home store account or visiting customer account) can be viewed on the <b>Accounts Receivable Activity Report (A/R Activity RPT)</b>.</li>
            <li>Press <b>REPORT [SHIFT+F4]</b> at any screen behind the <b>SOURCE</b> desktop to obtain access to the <b>A/R Activity Report</b>.</li>
            <li>The column <b>Home Store</b> identifies the Home Store for each account. Accounts downloaded without a store number in this column are those assigned to your store.</li>
