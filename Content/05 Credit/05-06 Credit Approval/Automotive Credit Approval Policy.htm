        <h1>Automotive Credit Approval Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section ONLY applies to Automotive branches</h2>
        <p>If an account is only one (1) to thirty (30) days past due, <b>Warrensville Credit Office</b> approval is NOT required to release merchandise; selling to such an account is at the discretion of the <b>Branch Manager</b>. </p>
        <p>Conversely, the <b>Warrensville Credit Office</b> locks out any charge account that is more than thirty (30) days past due or overlimit. These accounts will require <b>Credit Office</b> approval before merchandise can be released. Merchandise may not be released to locked out accounts unless another tender type is offered such as cash, check, or credit card. If a payment is received from the customer that satisfies the past due AND overlimit condition, the <b>Warrensville Credit Office</b> will remove the lock upon notification from the branch. You will be given an approval code to be referenced on the transaction in the <b>Comments Field</b> of the <b>Sales Header</b>. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>If you are unable to reach the <b>Warrensville Credit Office</b>, you may release merchandise if payment is received from the customer that pays the past due balance AND overlimit condition. Immediately notify your <b>Warrensville Credit Manager</b> via email that the payment was received and that you released merchandise. <b>Warrensville</b> will send you an approval number via email. </li>
