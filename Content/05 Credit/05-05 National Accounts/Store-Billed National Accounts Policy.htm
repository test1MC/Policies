        <h1>Store-Billed National Accounts  Policy</h1>
        <p>A national account customer is a customer that buys for, directs, or influences from a central office many geographically dispersed units and has a substantial overall potential for the purchase of paint, floorcovering, and wallcovering.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Firms who have $500,000 in annual purchases, multiple locations, and substantial purchase potential for either paint, wallcovering, or floorcovering are prospects for national account buying agreements.</li>
            <li>Large paint contractors who do work across the country or in multiple locations may also qualify for national account status.</li>
            <li>The term "national account" is reserved solely for those companies who have been designated as such and agreed to Sherwin-Williams’ national account purchasing arrangements.</li>
            <li><b>Cleveland National Accounts Department</b> makes the final decision regarding whether or not a company will be considered a national account.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>The headquarters of a national account approves our <b>National Account Agreement</b>. Credit approval for national accounts is initially established by the <b>National Accounts Department</b>. The credit limit is ultimately the responsibility of the <b>District Credit Office</b>.</li>
                <li>Stores are assigned to service the various locations of the national account.</li>
                <li>When a new national account is established, or noteworthy changes to an existing account occur, notification to all involved Sherwin-Williams locations is made.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>National account price record cards are maintained by the <b>Cleveland National Accounts Department</b> on a centralized pricing server. </li>
            <li>The highest price charged a national account will be the published <b>National Account Price List</b>.</li>
            <li>Exception pricing will be used for commodity type products used regularly by each account.</li>
            <li>All sales to national accounts remain on store books and are managed through the <b>District Credit Office</b>. The store making the sale retains 100% sales credit. </li>
            <li>Stores are provided with an alphabetical listing of national and regional accounts each January. The <b>National and Regional Account List</b> provides account affiliations and the respective <b>Account Executive</b> and their telephone number, if the account is centrally priced or receives a marketing commission.</li>
