        <h1>National Billed Accounts Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>National Billed Accounts Program</b> is designed to provide a service to qualified and credit-worthy customers that purchase nationwide, require flexibility in invoicing, and desire to remit to a single Sherwin-Williams location. National Billed Account status is reserved for accounts that have annual sales of $500,000 or more and multiple geographically disbursed locations.&#160;Stores receive sales credit, however, the receivable is automatically transferred to <b>Group Credit</b> in Cleveland. The store will be assessed a percentage of the sale as an expense (currently, 3.5%). Collection of the receivables is conducted at the group level. Stores may be requested to assist in the collection of certain "problem" accounts. All expenses for uncollected invoices and bad debt expense will be proportionately shared by all stores having sold the account. Any questions concerning a national billed account should be directed to the <b>National Billed Accounts Department</b> at 800-255-8597.</p>
