        <h1>DIY Cash on Completion Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive Branches.</h2>
        <p>Installed merchandise involves the installation of any material such as window treatment or floorcovering. Cash on completion is available only for DIY accounts with a pre-approved credit sale.&#160; </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>Cash on delivery (COD) accounts</b> may not be given any materials without first obtaining full payment.</li>
            <li><b>Lay-a-way</b> is not permitted.</li>
            <li>A <b>Floorcovering Proposal and Contract</b> or <b>Window Treatment Proposal and Contract Form</b> (655-0347) should be completed for any installed sale including cash on completion. Once signed, this form makes the customer legally responsible for paying for the special order merchandise. This protects the company from being left with special order goods that cannot be resold.</li>
            <li>A <b>Rescission Notice</b> complies with the <b>Federal Truth-in-Lending law</b>. It provides DIY accounts three working days to cancel a contract in which property might be taken as security for payment. The <b>Rescission Notice</b> should only be used when Sherwin-Williams is arranging for the installation of merchandise in the customer’s residence and is required regardless of the form of payment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <b>Floorcovering Proposal Contract</b> and <b>Rescission Notice</b> are available in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Use keyword “proposal” or “rescission” in the Form Name field to help locate each form. All available forms containing your search word(s) will appear below in the form description field.</p>
