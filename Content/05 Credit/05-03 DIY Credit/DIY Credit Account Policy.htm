        <h1>DIY Credit Account Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive Branches or non-US TAG locations.</h2>
        <p><b>Revolving Retail Credit Accounts [DIY accounts]</b> are available to help our customers meet their personal buying needs. Customers can eliminate up-front expenses and have the option to make monthly payments.</p>
        <p>As part of our automated new charge account process, sometimes we utilize personal credit reports to help in making a determination whether or not a charge account can be approved immediately. Before we order a personal credit report, though, we are required by the <b>Fair Credit Reporting Act</b> to have prior written approval from the individual(s) applying for the credit account. This approval comes in the form of our credit applications (retail and or commercial), which must be completed and signed by the individual(s).</p>

            <li>Customers may use their account at any company owned paint store in the United States, with the exception of <b>Automotive Stores</b>.</li>
            <li>Verify customer identification on all <b>retail credit card transactions</b> by asking to see the customer's driver's license (this is not required if you recognize the <b>DIY customer</b>).</li>
            <li>The customer must complete and sign a <b>Revolving Retail Credit Account Application</b>.</li>
            <li>Never sign a credit application on behalf of a customer.</li>
            <li>Never tell a customer a social security number is needed because it will not be used to obtain the personal credit report.</li>
            <li>For a joint account, both parties agree to share legal responsibility for payment of purchases on the account. Both parties must sign the application.</li>
            <li>Written authorization, acceptable to the <b>Retail Credit Department</b>, must be obtained for someone other than the person(s) listed on the application to use the account. This information must be kept on file at the store.</li>
            <li><b>US locations</b>:&#160; Once the <b>Revolving Retail Credit Account Application</b> process has been completed and confirmation of receipt of the application has been received from the <b>Retail Credit Department</b>, the social security number should be crossed out and the application should be shredded.&#160; </li>
