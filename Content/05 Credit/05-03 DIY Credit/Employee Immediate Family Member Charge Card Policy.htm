        <h1>Employee/Immediate Family Member Charge Card Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive Branches or non-US TAG locations.</h2>
        <p>These accounts have the same features and payment terms as a DIY account.&#160; For information on completing the <b>Sherwin-Williams Revolving Retail Credit Account Application</b>, please see information on the <MadCap:xref href="DIY Credit Account Policy.htm">DIY Credit Account Policy</MadCap:xref>&#160;Please see <MadCap:xref href="../../22 Discounts &amp; Donations/22-03 Employee &amp; Company Discount/Employee &amp; Company Discount Overview.htm">Employee &amp; Company Discount Overview</MadCap:xref> for information on processing sales made to an employee or an employee’s immediate family member.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>The employee must complete and sign a <b>Sherwin-Williams Revolving Retail Credit Account Application</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>Store Manager</b> must process the employee application using the online <b>Retail Credit Application</b> in the same manner a non-employee account is processed.&#160; Please see procedures for <MadCap:xref href="Create DIY Credit Account Procedure.htm">Create DIY Credit Account Procedure</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li>The <b>Store Manager</b> may not release any merchandise until the <b>Retail Credit Department</b> approves the account.</li>
            <li>Accounts should be opened as an <b>Employee Account</b> (Customer Type 9). Transactions will not automatically retrieve employee pricing without scanning the <b>Employee Discount Card</b> or <b>Extended Family Member Discount Card</b>.</li>
            <li>Employees purchasing merchandise and reselling the merchandise are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</li>
            <li>Employee accounts are for the personal use of the employee only and approved signers of the employee account. Employee accounts may not be used to charge merchandise for other customers or friends. Store employees who use their personal accounts to charge merchandise for others could be circumventing credit policy. This could be a conflict of interest that could result in disciplinary action. For additional information, refer to the <MadCap:xref href="../../06 Human Resources/06-12 Code of Conduct/Employee Conduct Policy.htm">Employee Conduct Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>If an employee is found using a personal charge account for others, contact the <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> or <b>Division Controller</b>.</li>
            <li>Someone other than the employee purchasing merchandise must process the sale.</li>
            <li>An employee account belonging to a store employee must be housed at the same store in which the employee works. Store employees that relocate to a new store must contact the <b>Retail Credit Department</b> to facilitate transfer of their account.</li>
