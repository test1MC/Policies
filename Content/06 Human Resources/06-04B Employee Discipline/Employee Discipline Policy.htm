        <h1>Employee Discipline Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Any discipline, except  informal counseling, should be agreed to by two levels of management (Example: <b>Store Manager </b>and<b> District Manager</b> with input from the <b>Area Human Resource Manager</b>).</li>
            <li>The <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b> or the <b>Area Human Resource Manager</b> must be consulted before any employee (both full-time &amp; part-time) is discharged.</li>
            <li>The <b>Division Loss Prevention Director</b> and <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b> must be consulted if the unacceptable behavior involves theft or misuse of Company assets.</li>
            <li>An employee may be given the opportunity to resign in lieu of discharge if, in the opinion of the <b>Division VP of Human Resource</b>, the best interests of the Company are served by such an action.</li>
            <li>The immediate supervisor must keep a written record of the marginal performance or unacceptable behavior, as well as all disciplinary action taken. This information can be captured on the <b>Written Summary of Unsatisfactory Conduct and Required Corrective Action Form</b>. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>When an employee is discharged, all written documentation, including the manager's copy of the employee's personnel file, will be sent immediately to the <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b>.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: All inquiries including reference checks about former employees will be referred to the <b>Human Resources Shared Services’ office</b> for response.</p>
