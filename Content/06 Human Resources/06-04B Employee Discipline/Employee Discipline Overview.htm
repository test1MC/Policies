        <h1>Employee Discipline Overview</h1>
        <p>Each Sherwin-Williams' employee is expected to perform his/her job duties in a responsible professional manner. Disciplinary action will be taken when an employee's performance is:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Marginal</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In violation of written policy, rules, or procedures</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Disruptive to the work environment</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Damaging to the Company's good business reputation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Threatening the health and safety of others</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purpose of discipline is to change unsatisfactory performance to satisfactory performance, unacceptable behavior to acceptable behavior, or to remove from the work force an employee who is unable or unwilling to perform his/her job duties in a satisfactory manner.</p>
