        <h1>Employment of Relatives Policy</h1>
        <p>Relatives of current employees will be considered to be hired, promoted, or transferred if they will not be working in the same store or department or under the supervision of a relative.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>The normal recruitment and placement procedure will not be circumvented in order to hire, promote, or transfer a relative of an employee. </li>
            <li>A candidate who is a relative of an employee will be considered along with non-relative candidates, and will be hired or promoted only if he/she is as well qualified as any other candidate.</li>
            <li>Persons placed in violation of this policy will be discharged or transferred to another location where placement is not in violation of this policy.</li>
            <li>When an employee becomes married to another employee in the same store or department, the Company may transfer one of the employees to another store or department.</li>
            <li>Once terminated, current employees working in the same store who have been "grandfathered" under this policy, will not be rehired.</li>
