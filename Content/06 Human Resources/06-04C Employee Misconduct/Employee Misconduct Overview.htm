        <h1>Employee Misconduct Overview</h1>
        <p>Employees should understand that their relationship with the Company is an At-Will one, and, as such, may be terminated at any time by either party. Nothing in these rules and regulations is intended by the Company to be an express or implied contract of employment/a guarantee of employment for a specific period of time between the employee and the Company. Other company policies, such as the <MadCap:xref href="../06-12 Code of Conduct/Code of Conduct Overview.htm">Code of Conduct Overview</MadCap:xref>, set forth additional principles regarding employee conduct. If you do not have a copy of these policies, ask your <b>supervisor</b> or the <b>human resource manager</b> for a copy because you will be required to comply.</p>
