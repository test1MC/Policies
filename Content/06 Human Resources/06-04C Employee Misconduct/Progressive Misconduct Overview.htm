            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Being disruptive continuously, which results in the slowing down or the interference of production and/or performance of himself/herself or a fellow employee</li>

Engaging in any practice which endangers the health and/or safety of himself or other employees, including acts of extreme carelessness or negligence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As in the past, in determining the penalty for an infraction of any of the above, the Company will give due and fair consideration to mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances. The Company is proud of the conduct of the large majority of its employees, and if each of us will consider all our actions in light of the above, compliance with these rules will most certainly follow as a normal course. Inappropriate conduct not specifically described in these rules will be handled as warranted by the circumstances of the case.</p>
