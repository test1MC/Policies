        <h1>ACORN Overview</h1>
        <p><b>ACORN</b>, the <b>Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now</b>, occasionally announces its plans to protest at select locations. Even though <b>ACORN</b> announces target cities, we should be ready for the unexpected. In the past, <b>ACORN</b> has shown up unannounced at S-W facilities in cities not on their original target list. For this reason it is advisable for <strong class="Strong" style="font-weight: normal;">all facilities</strong> to review the proper response for dealing with demonstrations and civil disturbances. If <b>ACORN</b> demonstrators show up at your location, please alert Mike Conway, <b>Director Corporate Communications &amp; Investor Relations</b>. Mike will be responsible for tracking <b>ACORN</b>’s activities and following up on media inquiries. Mike can be reached at:</p>
