                            <li>Do not make any statements to reporters or answer any questions regarding <b>ACORN</b>, the protest, or lead paint lawsuits. </li>
                            <li>Offer reporters our <a href="http://sherlink2.sherwin.com/stores/policy/06.0/pdf/writtenstatement.pdf">written statement</a> and suggest that they contact <b>Mike Conway</b> if they have any additional questions or require clarification.</li>
                            <li>In the unlikely event that <b>ACORN</b> demonstrators enter your location with a TV news camera, their own video camera (or video cell phone) or audio recording device, calmly inform them that cameras and recorders are not allowed in our stores and provide them with <b>Mike Conway’s contact information</b>.</li>
                            <li>Be aware some demonstrators may try to provoke you or trigger a confrontation in front of the media. They may attempt to instigate an angry reaction like putting your hand in front of the video camera or attempting to push them out the door. No matter what happens remain calm, polite, and diplomatic. This will communicate that we are confident and have nothing to hide.</li>

                            <li>It is lawful to peaceable protest on public property. </li>
                            <li>If protestors are on SW owned or leased property (in the building, in the SW leased or owned parking lots), they may be asked to leave. If they do not comply, the authorities can be contacted. Protests generally  last 1-2 hours.</li>
                            <li>Other than requesting protestors leave SW property, avoid engaging demonstrators or the media in conversation. Professional conduct on our part is of pinnacle importance. </li>
                            <li>Remain calm and polite, we have nothing to hide. If necessary, you may provide <b>ACORN</b> with our written statement. </li>
                            <li>You may also furnish the following phone number that contains a special message pertaining to lead paint: (216) 515-7917. Again, it is requested that we avoid statements to demonstrators or the media. </li>
                            <li>Forward them to the SW contacts noted in the written statement. </li>
                            <li>If <b>ACORN</b> demonstrators show up at your location, please ensure that <b>Director of Communications Mike Conway</b> is notified immediately at (216) 515-4393 so that <b>ACORN</b> activities can be centrally tracked.<br /></li>

                        <p>Note: Please notify <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> if questions or problems arise. When time permits, please report demonstration events to <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> in addition to communicating to <b>Mike Conway's office</b>. </p>

                            <li><b>ACORN’s</b> accusations concerning Sherwin-Williams and old lead paint are simply not true. These attacks on our company ignore the historical facts about lead-based paint.</li>
                            <li>Sherwin-Williams has a long history of corporate responsibility and working cooperatively with public officials and communities to help protect children from hazards due to neglected home maintenance. </li>
                            <li>The best way to protect children from lead poisoning is to make sure that property owners maintain their properties. The Cities know where the poorly maintained properties are. They should enforce the laws that require landlords to maintain their properties. </li>
                            <li>Lead pigment lawsuits are an attempt by greedy trial lawyers to generate fees rather than address the problem and protect kids.</li>
