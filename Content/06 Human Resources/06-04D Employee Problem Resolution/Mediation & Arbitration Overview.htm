        <h1>Mediation &amp; Arbitration Overview</h1>
        <p>Mediation is the preferred method because it provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trained, certified, and neutral third-party</li>
            <li>Means of open communications with or without legal counsel</li>
            <li>Focus on the parties on their real interests </li>
            <li>Appropriate, neutral meeting place</li>
            <li>Discussion of creative solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Company bears the entire cost of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and the Mediator. Similarly, neither party is required to accept the Mediator’s suggestion; however, if a resolution is agreed upon, an agreement would be signed and is binding. </p>
        <p>If the employee and the Company do not agree to mediation or cannot resolve the dispute through mediation, the employee is required to submit the claim to arbitration, in lieu of a judicial proceeding.  Although mediation is the preferred method, arbitration offers additional advantages:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 45pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Privacy and confidentiality</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Speed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reduced cost</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Experienced and neutral decision makers</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Binding resolution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resolving a claim through arbitration rather than through the court, does not waive the employee’s or the Company’s substantive legal rights; it merely changes the forum in which those rights will be resolved. Sherwin-Williams recommends the employee retain and utilize legal counsel even though it is not required.&#160; The employee will bear his/her own attorney’s charges and the costs of producing evidence, unless applicable law provides for such remedies and the arbitrator imposes them.</p>
