        <h1>Claim of Discrimination or Termination Procedure </h1>
        <p><b>Claims of Discrimination</b> are used for all cases alleging discrimination (treating someone differently) or retaliation in any aspect of employment on a basis prohibited by law, except for those involving terminations. To prevail in arbitration in a dispute alleging a violation of law, the employee must prove under the same burden of proof that would be applicable if the employee had brought the claim in court that the law was violated under the legal principles applicable to such claim.</p>
        <p><b>Termination claims</b> are filed when it is alleged that the Company did not have cause for termination or there was a violation of law. </p>
