        <h1>Employee Problem Resolution Overview</h1>
        <p>All Sherwin-Williams’ employees are valued members of the company, which is demonstrated by employees’ length of service and the amount of internal promotions. Similar to our desire to improve products and service, we strive to refine our management approach by encouraging employees to communicate with their supervisors regarding personal or work-related matters that may adversely affect work performance. The purpose of <b>Problem Resolution Procedures</b> is to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Permit and encourage employees to challenge the application of Company policies, procedures, or practices that affect their employment situation without fear of retaliation</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure management is committed to communicating and solving workplace problems, which makes early resolution more likely</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Allow employees to provide feedback, request clarity and support, and learn more about available options</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Facilitate discreet conversations with <b>HR</b></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Set up appropriate methods to resolve the problem</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Allow management to investigate thoroughly, review the evidence fairly, and render a decision appropriate to the facts and circumstances involved</li>
        </ul>
