        <h1>Personal Appearance Standards Policy</h1>
        <p>The success of The Sherwin-Williams Company is built upon quality products and services that meet or exceed customer expectations. When customers enter a Sherwin-Williams store, they expect to find clean, well-stocked stores staffed by knowledgeable, professional employees. </p>
        <p><b>Personal Appearance Standards</b> are applicable to all store employees and Sales Reps. Each Division may establish additional required uniform or dress standards as long as they do not conflict with the <b>Personal Appearance Standards</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Good personal hygiene must be practiced at all times. Skin conditions which co-workers or customers find objectionable because of appearance, which creates a real or perceived health risk ,such as extreme cases of eczema, may require medical treatment and/or other reasonable measures to eliminate concerns by co-workers and customers.</li>
            <li>Hair must be clean and neatly groomed at all times. Extreme hairstyles and facial hair, which precludes an employee from safely performing an essential job function, are prohibited. </li>
            <li>Excessive jewelry, jewelry that presents a potential safety hazard, or facial jewelry (including, but not limited to: nose, eyebrow, cheek, and tongue rings or studs), are prohibited. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Extreme and/or offensive jewelry is also prohibited.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Visible extreme or offensive body art (including tattoos) is prohibited.</li>
            <li>T-shirts, tank tops, shorts, jeans, leggings, sweat pants, painter pants, and extremely short, tight-fitting, revealing, or otherwise suggestive clothing are prohibited. </li>
            <li>All head coverings, unless approved by the <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b>, are prohibited.</li>
            <li>Tennis shoes, sandals, flip-flops or any open-toed shoes are prohibited. </li>
            <li>Name tags must be worn during all working hours.</li>
            <li>Extreme dress, adornment and hairstyles, as well as objectionable or offensive body piercing and tattoos will be addressed on an individual basis. Management reserves the right to determine what is extreme, objectionable or offensive.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Employees are expected to comply with these standards. Violation of the standards will result in discipline up to and including discharge. Any employee who believes he/she is being treated unfairly with respect to <b>Personal Appearance Standards</b> can appeal using the <b>Problem Resolution Procedure</b>.</p>
