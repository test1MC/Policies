        <h1>Employee Termination Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Unless advised to do so by <b>Division or The Americas Group Management</b>, supervisors will not discuss the circumstances of any employee's termination with anyone, including other employees, customers, potential employers, etc. Supervisors will simply state the individual is no longer employed and refer all inquires, reference checks, etc., to <b>The Work Number</b> at 1-800-367-5690 or www.theworknumber.com. The Sherwin-Williams Company code is <b>10429</b>.</li>
            <li>Any outstanding expense reports must be submitted and all Company property (including the employee discount card) must be returned before an employee is given the final paycheck.</li>
            <li>The terminated employee will be paid through the last day worked plus earned unused vacation and/or personal holidays not taken.</li>
            <li>When an employee who is voluntarily terminating employment gives notice but management prefers not to allow the employee to work out the notice, the employee will be given two weeks pay or the amount of notice given, whichever is less, as "pay in lieu of notice".</li>
