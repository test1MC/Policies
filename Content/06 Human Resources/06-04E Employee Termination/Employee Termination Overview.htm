        <h1>Employee Termination Overview</h1>
        <p>The employee relationship with the Company is an At-Will relationship, and as such may be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause or notice. Nothing in the application form, employee handbook, or Company policy manuals is intended by the Company to be an expression or implied contract of employment/guarantee of employment for a specific period of time between the employee and the Company, unless there is a written employment agreement signed by an officer listed in the annual report. All terminated employees, whether voluntary or involuntary, will be treated fairly and with respect. Employment may be terminated for economic reason or various other reasons unrelated to the employee's work performance or behavior.</p>
