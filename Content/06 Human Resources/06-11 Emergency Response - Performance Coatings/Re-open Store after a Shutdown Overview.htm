        <h1>Re-open Store after a Shutdown Overview</h1>
        <p>After any <b>site shutdown</b>, we want to get back to normal, and back to business, as safely and as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Here are some tips to help you plan for the aftermath of a shutdown:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify <b>other S-W locations</b> that can serve your customers.</li>
            <li>Have a list of <b>key customers</b> saved in your phone to stay in contact.</li>
            <li>Forward the <b>facility phone</b> to your cell phone, if possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Review the following <b>EHS Considerations</b> with Employees or Contractors prior to doing the <b>Cleanup Work</b>:</p>
