        <h1>Crisis Management Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>Crisis Management Program</b> allows Sherwin-Williams to respond to unpredictable, unknown situations that can rapidly change. Refer to the <b>PCG Emergency Response Plan</b> to prepare for challenging, yet predictable situations.</p>
        <p>During a natural disaster, our primary concern is the welfare of our employees, their families, our customers, and others we can reasonably assist.</p>
        <p>In the event of a crisis, take the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Report hurricane, tornado, earthquake, to <a href="mailto:incidentreport@sherwin.com">incidentreport@sherwin.com</a> or call 216-855-4225.</li>
            <li><b>PCG Crisis Management Lead</b> will notify <b>PCG &amp; Corporate Crisis team</b>.</li>
            <li>Account for all employees in the affected area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mobilize required resources and constant updates until crisis is over.</p>
