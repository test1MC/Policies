        <h1>Human Resources Overview</h1>
        <p>Every manager is expected to make sound human resource decisions based on the particular circumstances of each situation. The <b>Group Director of Human Resource Services</b> will resolve questions.</p>
        <p>The <b>Payroll Department</b> will issue checks unless instructed in writing to do otherwise by the <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b>.</p>
        <p>Each employee works at-will, and, with or without cause or notice, the employee or the Company may terminate this relationship at any time. These guidelines are not intended to change, limit, or modify this relationship on behalf of either the Company or the employee. This relationship can only be modified by the written contract signed by an officer of the Company listed in the current <b>Annual Report of Sherwin-Williams</b>.</p>
