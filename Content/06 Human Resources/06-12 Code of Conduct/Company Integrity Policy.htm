        <h1>Company Integrity Policy</h1>
        <p>Every <b>Sherwin-Williams employee</b> must conduct their business activities with the highest standards of integrity and comply fully with the applicable laws, rules and regulations in each country where we conduct business. Employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with each other as well as our customers, vendors and other third parties. Employees must also comply with any other applicable policies and procedures of the Company.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Do not take a <b>part-time job</b> where you may be tempted to spend time on that job during your normal working hours or to use Company equipment, materials or assets to support the other job.</li>
            <li>Do not direct business to a supplier that is owned or managed by a <b>relative</b> or <b>close friend</b>. </li>
            <li>Do not obtain <b>non-public information</b> by <b>illegal activities</b> involving industrial espionage, or by asking a competitor’s employees or contractors, or former employees or contractors.</li>
            <li>Do not use or engage consultants, agents, friends, or others to undertake activities to obtain <b>competitive information</b> that would be unacceptable if pursued by you directly.</li>
            <li>Do not give, offer, or authorize anything of value, such as money, goods, or services, to a customer or <b>government official</b> to obtain any <b>improper advantage</b>.</li>
            <li>Do not give or offer a <b>business courtesy</b>, such as a gift, contribution or entertainment, under circumstances that might create the appearance of an impropriety.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>1.1 Conflicts of Interest</b>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>You are expected to make business decisions and take actions based upon the best interests of <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> and not based upon personal relationships or benefits. <b>Conflicts of interests</b>, and the appearance of conflicts of interest, can damage our reputation. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>A conflict of interest is any activity, investment, interest, association or relationship (including relationships with family members, relatives, friends and social acquaintances) which conflicts with the independent <b>exercise of judgment</b> in connection with your duties and/or employment. </li><li>A conflict of interest occurs when your personal interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with the Company’s interests. Each of us is required to perform our respective duties in good faith and in a loyal manner, and to not engage in any activity that is, or appears to be, a conflict of interest. </li></ol></li>
            <li>Receiving <b>personal benefits</b> from others due to your status as an employee may lead to conflicts of interest. You must disclose to your <b>manager</b>, and your appropriate <b>HR representative</b>, all situations where you or your <b>Sherwin-Williams group</b> may be conducting business with members of your family, friends or others with whom you have a close personal relationship. At no time can you use any company property, information or other assets for personal gain or to compete with Sherwin-Williams.</li>
            <li>Our policy does not prohibit all <b>outside employment</b>, but you have a duty to ensure that outside employment and other activities do not negatively impact your work at Sherwin-Williams, cause you to misuse our information or assets, or result in consequences unfair to Sherwin-Williams. You may not engage in any outside employment or activities that may improperly influence, or appear to influence, your judgment, decisions or actions with respect to your position at Sherwin-Williams. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>To assess whether a potential conflict of interest may exist, you need to consider the activities in which you may be engaging, regardless of whether you may be called an “employee,” “consultant,” “contractor,” “owner,” “investor,” or “volunteer.”</li></ol></li>
            <li>You may not have a personal or family <b>financial interest</b> (investment, ownership or creditor interests, except for the acquisition or ownership of nominal holdings of securities or other obligations of a company whose securities are publicly traded) in any of our customers, distributors, suppliers, other business partners or competitors.</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of this policy depends in large part on the cooperation of all employees in disclosing situations that may be contrary to the intent of the policy and the ethical standards that it expresses. Your responsibility is to use your best judgment to evaluate objectively whether your outside activities, personal or financial interests may lead to divided loyalties. </li>
            <li>You must promptly disclose in writing by filling out a <b>potential conflicts of interest form</b> and submitting the form to your <b>manager</b> and your <b>HR representative</b> any situation that could present a conflict of interest with your role at Sherwin-Williams. Copies of your disclosure and the Company’s response will be kept in your employee relations file. You will have a continuing obligation to disclose any change in circumstances that could affect the Company’s interests. </li>

            <li>As a global business, we conduct our business in compliance with laws and regulations designed to promote <b>fair competition</b> and encourage ethical and legal behavior among competitors. <b>Antitrust laws and fair competition laws</b> generally prohibit any activity that restrains free trade and limits competition, such as price fixing, illegal cartels, boycotts, and tie-ins. </li>
            <li>While basic antitrust and competition law principles apply worldwide, there are significant country and regional differences. If you are engaged in multinational business activities, you are required to be aware of, and abide by, all the laws that apply. </li>
            <li>We must have timely and complete information about <b>industry developments</b> in order to stay competitive. We only obtain competitive information by fair and legal methods.
