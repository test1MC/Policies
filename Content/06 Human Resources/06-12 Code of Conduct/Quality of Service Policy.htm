        <h1>Quality of Service Policy</h1>
        <p><b>Sherwin-Williams</b> requires all employees to be ethical and lawful in their dealings with suppliers, service providers and vendors, as well as our Sherwin-Williams colleagues. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Do not establish <b>supplier relationships</b> without engaging the assistance of <b>purchasing department personnel</b>.</li>
            <li>Do not choose a supplier on any basis other than <b>open and competitive bidding</b>.</li>
            <li>Do not allow the <b>Sherwin-Williams name and/or logo</b> to be used in any supplier advertising or promotional material without obtaining approval from your <b>business unit senior management</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>3.1 Selecting and Maintaining Relationships with Business Providers</b>
        </p>
        <p>You must use care and good judgment in selecting and maintaining relationships with all of <b>Sherwin-Williams' business providers</b>. Employees who participate in the selection of any business provider must:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Use a selection process that is fair, lawful, does not improperly discriminate, and complies with all Company policies and procedures</li>
            <li>Ensure <b>business providers</b> are apprised of their obligation to conduct their business activities in an ethical and legal manner</li>
            <li>Obtain all required <b>approvals</b> before signing agreements</li>
            <li>Never reveal <b>confidential information</b> about one vendor to another vendor or to any other third party. Disclosures of such information, even within Sherwin-Williams, should be limited to those with a need to know the information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>3.2 Managing Suppliers </b>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Properly managing relationships with suppliers is vital to our success. We are required to deal with suppliers in a professional and fair manner and document properly all transactions. You may not enter into or request procurement to enter into any transactions or arrangements that assist a supplier in manipulating revenue or expense recognition. The existence and the terms of contracts between <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> and its suppliers are considered confidential and are not to be disclosed to any other party. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>3.3 Supplier Pricing</b>
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>You are responsible for working with procurement to negotiate and obtain the best possible <b>supplier/customer arrangement</b>. Negotiations with suppliers should be conducted in the best interest of Sherwin-Williams and in compliance with Company policies and applicable law. </li>
            <li>While we may have no legal obligation to protect <b>price information</b> unless required by contractual terms, negotiated price information is usually competitively significant and must be handled as <b>confidential information</b>. In general, we will not disclose the <b>non-public prices</b> of one supplier to another, or to anyone else within or outside of <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> who does not have a legitimate business reason to know. If disclosure of negotiated pricing information or other terms is required for <b>contract manufacturers</b> or <b>service providers</b>, you must abide by the Company’s policies on handling confidential information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>3.4 Sherwin-Williams as a Company Reference</b>
        </p>
        <p><b>The Sherwin-Williams name and brand</b> is a valuable asset that other companies may want to exploit. We are responsible for protecting the Sherwin-Williams name and brand from unauthorized and inappropriate use. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>You may not permit any supplier or other party to use the <b>Sherwin-Williams name, logo, or other branding</b> in its advertising, promotional materials, customer references or the like, without <b>approval</b> from your <b>business unit senior management</b>. </li>
            <li>You may not permit any supplier to mention Sherwin-Williams as a customer or disclose the terms of any contract with Sherwin-Williams in an offering document such as a <b>prospectus</b> or a <b>securities registration statement</b>. </li>
        </ol>
