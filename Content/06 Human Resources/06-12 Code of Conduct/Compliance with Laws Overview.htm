The Code is intended to supplement, not replace, employee handbooks and other policies and procedures. The Code and the policies described in it are not an employment contract. However, the Code sets forth expectations of behaviors and employees who violate the spirit or letter of the Code are subject to disciplinary action up to and including <b>termination of employment</b>.</p>
