        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Stores must contact the <b>District Credit Office</b> in order to credit and rebill an invoice when the original charge and potential rebill occur within two different months, whether between two jobs on the same account or between two different accounts.</li>
            <li>Stores must contact the <b>District Credit Office</b> for approval to correct a sale processed on the wrong job or processed on the wrong territory.</li>
            <li><b>TRC States only</b>:&#160;Job split corrections must be run on the charge when the correction will result in a tax discrepancy between the original sale and the rebill.</li>
            <li>Customer signature is not required for either the <b>Return Transaction</b> or the <b>Rebill Sale Transaction</b> when the <b>Return Reason Code</b> is “wrong job” or “wrong account.”</li>
