            </ol>
            <li>Occasionally you may be required to follow the <b>After Hours sale procedures</b>. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../../19 Store Computer (POS) Basics/19-02D POS Close &amp; End of Day/After Hours Sales Policy.htm">After Hours Deposit &amp; Sale  Policy</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li><b>Manual POST Forms</b> should not be used for <b>Locked Out Accounts</b>.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Process an order in <b>Customer Order Entry</b> for <b>Locked Out Accounts</b> once you receive approval from the <b>DCO</b>. Answer <b>YES</b> to the “DELIVER?”, so that the document has a customer signature line. </li>

                <li>Process the <b>point of sale transaction</b> as soon as the account is unlocked by the <b>DCO</b>. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>The Customer must have a valid account in good standing for all <b>Charge Sales</b>.</li>
            <li>You must call for approval for visiting customer purchases over $250.00. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../../05 Credit/05-04 Visiting Customer/Visiting Customer Overview.htm">Visiting Customer Overview</MadCap:xref></li>

            <li>If the sale is going to be <b>NO TAX</b>, a completed <b>Tax Exemption Certificate</b> MUST be on file at the store. Customer must sign each <b>NO TAX transaction</b>.</li>

            <li>Sherwin-Williams employees should only enter appropriate comments on <b>point-of-sale transactions</b> and <b>customer orders</b> because all comments print on customer invoices and statements. Any racial, ethnic, or derogatory remark entered on a <b>point-of-sale transaction</b> or <b>customer order</b> is considered <a href="http://sherlink2.sherwin.com/stores/policy/06.0/html_files/06-04.htm"><MadCap:xref href="../../06 Human Resources/06-04C Employee Misconduct/Gross Misconduct Overview.htm">Gross Misconduct Overview</MadCap:xref> </a>and usually results in termination.</li>
            <li><b>Customer orders</b> may be placed in the <b>POS</b> during a promotional pricing period to hold the price when stock is not available in the store to fulfill the customer's request.&#160;The order must be processed within four (4) weeks of the promotion end date or the order lines must be canceled and re-entered at regular pricing.</li>
            <li>Sales can only be run under an account for individuals authorized to use the account.&#160; </li>
            <li>Sales should not be run against other accounts for the purposes of granting discounted pricing. Store Employees should not open <b>retail/DIY accounts</b> classifying them as commercial for the purposes of granting discounted pricing.</li>
