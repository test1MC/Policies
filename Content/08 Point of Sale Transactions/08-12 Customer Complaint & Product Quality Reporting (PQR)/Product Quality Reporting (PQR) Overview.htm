        <h1>Product Quality Reporting (PQR)  Overview</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Floorcovering Facilities. For more information, please see <MadCap:xref href="../../14 Floorcovering/14-04 Floorcovering Customer Orders/Floorcovering Customer Orders Policy.htm">Floorcovering Customer Orders Policy</MadCap:xref>.</h2>
        <p><b>PQR</b> is used for all customer complaints and quality issues at your store. The problem can be as simple as a customer returning a gallon because he/she did not like the color to as complex as a product failure with a potential liability of $20,000. The <b>PQR</b> should be entered by the store that sold the material directly to the purchasing customer. Whenever you have a customer unhappy with a product requesting merchandise or financial reimbursement, need help figuring out a problem, or just need to make sure someone is aware of a product issue, <b>PQR</b> is the answer. Customer concerns addressed through <b>PQR</b> may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> label guarantee</li>
            <li> warranty</li>
            <li> mistints</li>
            <li>all other product issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this situation, there is no concern of a product failure and settlement is immediate for merchandise, but not for labor. If help is needed in determining a potential product failure, the original transaction is entered into the <b>PQR</b> website and specific detail concerning the product is recorded, including the potential liability involved. </p>
