        <h1>Payment on Account Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Payments on account are made against a balance due on an established Sherwin-Williams account. Payments may be made with <b>Cash, Check, Credit Card, Gift Card</b>, or a combination of these.</li>
            <li>Employees are not permitted to process their own <b>point of sale transactions</b>. This includes ALL <b>point of sale transactions</b>. Another employee must process the <b>point of sale transaction</b>. </li>
            <li>If a payment is made in person, it MUST be entered through the store computer system before the customer leaves the store.</li>
            <li>Payments received in the mail MUST be processed on the day received.</li>
            <li>Notify the <b>Home store</b> if one of their customers makes a payment at your store.</li>
            <li>Record the transaction numbers being paid. If unavailable press <b>CANCEL [F5]</b>, press the <b>COMMENTS [F9]</b> key to enter the reason for not including specific transaction information.</li>
            <li>If the payment is made by check, record the check number in the <b>Check Log</b> window during <b>Form of Payment</b>.</li>
            <li>Payments by check cannot be post-dated unless <b>District Credit</b> gives approval. Once approval is received from <b>District Credit</b> a <b>Post-Dated Check form</b> may need to be completed and signed by the customer and processing employee (check with the <b>District Credit Office</b> to see if the form is required). If required, the original copy of the <b>Post-Dated Check form</b> must be retained at the store. A copy must be forwarded to the <b>District Credit Office</b>. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li><b>Post-Dated Check Form</b> is located in the <b>Forms Repository</b>: from <b>POS desktop</b>, select <b>Browser</b> -&gt; Access <b>Source homepage</b> -&gt; <b>Information Library</b> <br />-&gt; <b>Forms Repository</b>. </li></ol></li>
            <li>You are required to retain the customer's <b>remittance</b> in a folder at the store. Note the customer account number, payment transaction number, and payment date on the <b>remittance</b> or staple a copy of the payment on account transaction to the <b>remittance</b> and file by date.
