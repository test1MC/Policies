        <h1>Customer Payment Information Overview</h1>
        <p>Follow these guidelines when handling customer information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not mail in <b>payment receipt disbursements</b> (including close transactions) and/or <b>customer remittance</b> to the <b>Cleveland Credit Center</b>.</li>
            <li>Retain all <b>customer payment information</b> at your store (file by transaction number).</li>
            <li>When processing a payment, type <b>invoice numbers</b> in the <b>[Remit] area</b> and any other relevant information in the <b>[Comments] section</b>.</li>
            <li>Fax <b>customer payment information</b> as soon as possible when it is requested by the <b>Credit Center</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: <b>Customer Payment Information</b> is anything customers have given you to designate invoices they are paying. It could be a check stub, a statement stub, a list they compiled on a separate sheet of paper, etc. If you have any questions, call the <a href="#national_credit">National Credit Center</a>. </p>
