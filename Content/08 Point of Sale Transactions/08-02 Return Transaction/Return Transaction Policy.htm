        <h1>Return Transaction Policy</h1>
        <p>A <b>Return Transaction</b> is used any time a refund is given to your customer.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Employees are not permitted to process their own <b>point-of-sale transactions</b>. Another employee must process the <b>point-of-sale transaction</b>.</li>
            <li>Merchandise accepted for a return must be unused, undamaged, and returned within 30 days from the date of purchase.</li>
            <li>A refund may be made with <b>Cash, Credit Card, Store Draft, or Store Credit (gift card)</b>.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li><b>Store Credit (gift card)</b> may only be offered to the customer in instances where the customer originally paid by credit card and no longer has the credit card or credit account used for the original transaction.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The original receipt barcode must be scanned, if available.</li>
            <li>Customer information (name, address, city, state, zip code, phone, customer signature) must be complete and accurate (no abbreviations) anytime the customer receives (cash or credit card) credit or store draft on a <b>Cash Refund</b> or <b>Cash Correction Transaction</b>.</li>
            <li>A draft must be used if the cash refund is over $100. A draft must also be used if there is not enough cash in the drawer to cover the refund and the store would be left with insufficient operating funds. Because <b>Duron, MAB Paints, Columbia Paint and General Paint stores</b> do not have store drafts, these employees should refer to the <MadCap:xref href="No Drafts - Cash Refund Over $100 Policy.htm">No Drafts – Cash Refund Over $100 Policy</MadCap:xref> Procedure for more instructions.</li>
            <li>You are required to enter the name of the person signing all <b>Sherwin-Williams Charge Returns</b>. </li>
            <li>You are required to enter customer specific information while processing <b>Preferred Customer or Corrections</b>. </li>
            <li>The employee who processes the return must enter their employee password before the cash drawer will open. The processing employee is required to sign the return form.</li>
            <li>The processing employee is responsible for entering the return date and initialing the returned item on the customer's receipt after drawing a line through the entry on the sales invoice (if the customer does not want the original receipt you can simply tear up the receipt and throw it away).</li>
            <li>The customer should have a receipt to return the merchandise. If a customer does not have a receipt, ask the customer for proper identification and ask the <b>Store Manager</b> for approval.</li>
            <li>All returns must be approved by the <b>Store Manager</b> at the time of the return. If the <b>Manager</b> is not available, the <b>Manager</b> must review and approve the transaction as soon as possible after the return has been made.</li>
            <li>The amount of the return may not exceed the original sale. This refers to any discounts, markdowns, or sale prices that may have been in effect when the original purchase was made.</li>
            <li>If the return is customized merchandise and is returnable to the vendor, the customer must be charged any re-stocking fees.</li>
            <li>If the original purchase was with check, allow fourteen (14) days for customer check to clear the bank before completing the refund. Some stores have the option to refund check payments as drafts or in <b>SWeep</b>. If customers request a check as the form of refund, inform them that a check will be mailed to them after the fourteen- (14) day period. <b>This only applies to stores located in the Continental U.S.</b></li>
            <li>You are permitted to give the customer their check back if they request a complete refund the same day that the purchase was made. Process a return for the total amount. Make a note in the comments area that you are returning the customer's check. The <b>[form of refund]</b> will be <b>[cash]</b>. You are required to document your cash/check variance during the close process. </li>
            <li>Sales originally made via credit card can ONLY be credited to the same credit card.&#160;Cash, draft, return to card, or charge other than that used in the original sale is not permitted.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>If the customer no longer has the credit card account used for the original purchase, the return may be processed to the customer as store credit via <b>Gift Card</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The <b>Correction Transaction</b> should not be used when merchandise is returned and the customer makes an additional purchase. A <b>return transaction</b> should be processed to return merchandise and a <b>sales transaction</b> should be processed to sell new merchandise.</li>
            <li>You are able to change the <b>Bill-To information</b> on all <b>Business-to-Business sales and return transactions</b> to properly reflect the customer information. This will enable you to capture accurate customer information related to the <b>Business-to-Business customer</b> that is picking up the merchandise. This process ensures that <b>Cash Refund Verification Letters</b> are sent to the purchaser rather than the main office of the <b>Business-To-Business account</b>.</li>
            <li>Several states do not allow the refund of sales tax to customers that return merchandise.&#160; Please review the sales tax bulletin in <MadCap:xref href="../../13 Tax/13-03 State Tax Bulletins/Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure.htm">Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure</MadCap:xref> or call the <b>Tax Department</b> for further assistance.&#160;When customers return merchandise in the states below, the corresponding sales tax may not be refunded as indicated below:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li><b>Michigan</b> - After 180 days of the original purchase date</li>
                <li><b>Rhode Island</b> - After 120 days of the original purchase date</li>
                <li><b>Massachusetts</b> - After 90 days of the original purchase date</li>
                <li><b>Connecticut</b> - After 90 days of the original purchase date OR if the customer does not have a receipt.&#160; This does not apply to even exchanges.</li>
