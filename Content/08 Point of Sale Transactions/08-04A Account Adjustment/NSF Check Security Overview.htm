        <h1> NSF Check Security Overview</h1>
        <p>If a customer has given an <b>NSF check</b> or a check on a closed account as a <b>payment on account</b>, then contact your <b>District Credit Office</b> immediately. Further credit sales or acceptance of checks must be approved by the <b>District Credit Office</b>. It is imperative that you validate each check in the store computer system. If your system is down, use the <b>For Deposit Only check stamp</b> to mark the check. Remember to capture customer information on the <b>manual POST form</b>.</p>
