        <h1>Joint Check  Agreement  Overview</h1>
        <p>A <b>joint check agreement</b> occurs between the painter, contractor, or property owner who hired the painter and Sherwin-Williams. The contractor or property owner agrees to make payments (checks) to the painter for materials supplied to a specific job payable to both Sherwin-Williams and the painter. This helps to ensure that Sherwin-Williams will be paid for materials charged to the painter’s job account.</p>
