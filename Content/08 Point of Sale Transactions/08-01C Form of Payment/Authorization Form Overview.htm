        <h1>Authorization Form Overview</h1>
        <p>In an effort to comply with credit card security obligations while providing our customers convenient service, the following forms have been authorized for transaction processing if the credit card is not present:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Authorization to Retain and Use Customer Credit Card Information</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Authorization for a Third Party to Charge to a Credit Card</li>
        </ul>
        <p>New laws in <b>California</b> and <b>Massachusetts</b> require that stores in these states do not request Zip Code information from customers in order to process a <b>credit card transaction</b>. If the credit card is not available to swipe, the system may prompt you to enter a Zip Code. In this case, you may only enter a Zip Code provided by the customer on the <b>Authorization to Retain and Use Form</b>. If the card is not present and no form is filed, enter ‘00000’ for the Zip Code. You will also need to enter ‘00000’ when recording <b>downtime POS transactions</b> in the system from <b>manual forms</b>. Requesting Zip Code information is permitted for other purposes, such as gathering address information for a delivery or creating <b>new customer/preferred customer accounts</b>.</p>
        <p>Find descriptions of <b>Authorization Forms</b> below:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td style="font-weight: bold;">
                    <p>Retain and Use Information</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Completed and signed <b>Authorization to Retain and Use Credit Card Information Forms</b> are the only permissible method to collect and to retain customer credit card information for future transactions. Additionally, this form is used to obtain customer authorization to make a payment on a <b>Sherwin-Williams Charge Account</b> by credit card. If customers are unable or refuse to sign, you are required to call them for credit card information for each transaction.  Customers are permitted to fax credit card information. Refer to <b>Faxed Credit Card Information</b> for retention guidelines.</p>
                    <p>You will not need to use the following forms if the customer presents a credit card at the time of payment:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Paint Stores: Authorization to Retain and Use</li>
                        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Automotive: Automotive Authorization to Retain and Use</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Find the <b>Authorization to Retain and Use Customer Credit Card Information</b> in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Search form name or keyword “retain” in the Form Name field. All available forms containing your search word will appear below in the form description field. All outdated forms and information should be destroyed three to six months after the credit card has expired. New forms must be submitted (and signed) for new information, including filing a different credit card for an existing customer.</p>
                    <p>Note: After processing the payment on account transactions, the form should be retained for records with payment documentation- the first 12-digits of the 16-digit card number should be blacked out and made illegible.</p>
