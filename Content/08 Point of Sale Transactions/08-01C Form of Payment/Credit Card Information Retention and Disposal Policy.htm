        <h1>Credit Card Information Retention and Disposal Policy</h1>
        <p>All locations must take measures to safeguard customers’ credit card information. Credit card information for future transactions must only be retained using the approved form. Access to completed and retained <b>Authorization Forms</b> must be restricted by following these policies:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Do not write customer credit card numbers and expiration dates in your notes.</li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain credit card information on the customer’s <b>Price Record Card</b> or <b>Customer Order</b>. </li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain customer credit card information in any electronic file, including password protected files. Electronic files include, but are not limited to, files for computers, cell phones, Treo, and PDA devices. </li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain customer credit card information on a printed report at the <b>POS</b>.</li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain the <b>Card Verification Value (CVV/CVV2)</b> numbers on any document. <b>Card Verification Value [CVV]</b> is the three digit number in the signature area on the back of <b>MasterCard and Visa cards</b>.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/08-01c Form of Payment3/Credit Card Security Policy_1.jpg" /></li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain the <b>Card Identification Digits (CID)</b> – the four-digit value on the front of <b>American Express cards</b> above the last series of embossed numbers.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/08-01c Form of Payment3/Credit Card Security Policy_2.jpg" /></li>
            <li>Do not capture or retain the <b>PIN Block</b> – the set of digits entered into the <b>PIN</b> pad during an authorization of a debit transaction.</li>
            <li>Do not email or fax completed authorization forms.</li>
            <li>Authorization forms represent an agreement between a single store location and the customer and cannot be shared between stores and must be completed separately&#160;by the customer for each store in which the customer wishes to make unattended credit sales or payments.&#160; </li>
            <li>Before using one of the <b>Authorization Forms</b>, view and verify the customer’s credit card and photo ID to ensure they match. Note:&#160;You risk the credit transaction being disputed and charged back if there is no proof that the card was present in the store or if there is no signed authorization from the customer (e.g. signed receipt, signed third-party authorization form, etc.). </li>
            <li>Customers or HQ may fax, email, or phone in credit card information for processing.&#160;Stores are not permitted to retain, maintain, or share this documentation.&#160; After processing, any printed material must be immediately shredded and electronic information must be deleted.</li>
            <li>All processed manual forms, including <b>imprinted manual credit card forms</b> and <b>processed manual POST forms</b>, must be retained in a folder titled <b>MANUAL POST FORMS – USED</b> and placed in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe to protect customer information. The <b>processed manual POST form</b> must be retained for 5 years plus the current year. However, the <b>manual credit card imprint</b> may be cross-cut shredded after 18 months. </li>
            <li>Forms expire based on <b>Credit Card Information Retention and Disposal Policy</b>.</li>
            <li>A monthly review to identify and destroy expired forms should be conducted.</li>
            <li>Stores should now utilize the <b>Credit Card Authorization Retention Log</b>, which is available in the forms repository. This log ensures that stores have contact information for customers whose credit information may be at risk because of theft or loss. It should be retained indefinitely. This log should be stored with customer files, and not in the store safe, so that if loss or theft do occur, then stores will still have access to contact information for those customers at risk. Auditors and loss prevention will ensure that these forms are handled properly and will help to mitigate by advising customers on how to handle the theft of their sensitive information.&#160;Note: Find the <b>Credit Card Authorization Retention Log</b> in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Search form name or keyword “retention” in the Form Name field. All available forms containing your search word will appear below in the form description field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: The <b>Credit Card Information Retention and Disposal Policy</b> must be strictly followed. <b>Credit Card security </b>and<b> PCI compliance</b> review are part of your <b>store audit</b>.</p>
