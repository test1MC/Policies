        <h1>Credit or Debit Card Payment Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not include Canadian Stores.</h2>
        <p>Customers may use a national credit or debit card to purchase merchandise. They may also use a combination of cash, check, or several credit cards.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Sherwin-Williams' stores will accept only <b>VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express credit cards or debit cards</b> that display the proper credit card logo.</li>
            <li>An <b>authorization number</b> is required for all credit card/debit card transactions (sales and returns) regardless of the amount (the <b>authorization number</b> is automatically returned to the <b>point of sale</b> screen after receiving authorization).</li>
            <li>Call for voice authorization if your customer uses two or more credit cards for form of payment. Remember to follow policy D to process the sale.</li>
            <li>The system will prompt employees to enter the Zip Code/Postal Code associated with the credit card being used when the card is not present within the store.  Employees of stores in states other than <b>California</b> and <b>Massachusetts</b> may request this information, but the customer is not required to provide this information.  If the customer declines to provide this information, the employee should enter ‘00000’ as the Zip Code.</li>
            <li>Laws in the states of <b>California</b> and <b>Massachusetts</b> require that <b>California and Massachusetts stores</b> do not to request Zip Code information from the customer in order to process a credit card transaction.  If the credit card is not available to swipe, the system may prompt you to enter a Zip Code.  In this event, you may only enter the Zip Code in the event that you are processing a transaction with credit card information provided by the customer on the <b>Authorization to Retain and Use Form</b>.  If the card is not present and no form is filed, please enter '00000' for the Zip Code.  You will also need to enter '00000' when recording downtime <b>POS transactions</b> in the system originally processed on a <b>manual form</b>.</li>
            <li>Requesting Zip Code information in any state is permitted for other purposes such as requesting address information for a delivery, creating a new customer account, or becoming a preferred customer member.</li>
            <li>The expiration date on the credit card/debit card must be checked prior to acceptance.</li>
            <li>The customer's signature on the credit card/debit card must be verified with the customer's signature on the store copy of the invoice.</li>
            <li>Complete a <b>Third party Credit Card Authorization Form</b> if a national credit card holder asks you to allow somebody other than the cardholder to make charges to the card. This will help avoid later disputes as to who was really authorized to charge and how much.</li>
            <li>The complete customer’s credit card number does not display on transactions paid by credit card [xxx-xxx-xxx-3222].</li>
            <li>If a credit card is not able to be swiped due to system downtime or an inactive mag strip, the card must be imprinted.</li>
            <li>To view, print, or complete <b>Charge/Credit Authorizations</b> on your system, find the <b>Asset Retirement/Transfer of Fixed Assets</b> in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Search form name or keyword “fixed” in the Form Name field. All available forms containing your search word will appear below in the form description field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note the differences between <b>Embossed and Unembossed Credit/Debit Cards</b>:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You are required to imprint the <b>embossed credit/debit card</b> on a completed <b>Manual Credit Card Form</b> if the number and name do not appear automatically on the screen when the credit card has been swiped. This will serve as proof that the credit card was in the store. </li>
                        <li>Call for voice authorization any time you use a <b>Manual POST Form</b> for a credit card sale (a <b>Manual Credit Card Form</b> must be completed when a <b>Manual POST Form</b> is used). The cash drawer will not open when validating a <b>Manual POST Form</b> because the computer system assumes that you have already received authorization for the credit card purchase. </li>
                        <li>All processed manual forms, including <b>imprinted manual credit card forms</b> and <b>processed manual POST forms</b>, must be retained in a folder titled <b>MANUAL POST FORMS – USED</b> and placed in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe to protect customer information. The processed <b>manual POST form</b> must be retained for 5 years plus the current year. However, the <b>manual credit card imprint</b> may be cross-cut shredded after 18 months. </li>

                        <li>The <b>unembossed Visa and MasterCard</b> may look and feel different, but it is a valid card that can be accepted at any Sherwin-Williams location. Unlike <b>embossed credit cards</b> with raised numbers, letters, and symbols, the <b>unembossed card</b> has a smooth, flat surface. </li>
                        <li>Processing an <b>unembossed card</b> at the <b>POS</b> should be seamless. Simply swipe the <b>unembossed card</b> just as you would an <b>embossed card</b>, verify authorization, and obtain the cardholder’s signature. </li>
                        <li>To comply with credit card industry standards and because of the <b>unembossed card’s flat surface</b>, it cannot be used for transactions that require a card imprint. </li>
                        <li>Therefore, if the <b>unembossed credit card magnetic stripe</b> cannot be read by the electronic credit card reader, ask the customer for another form of payment. </li>
                        <li>There are no downtime processing instructions for <b>unembossed credit cards</b>. </li>
