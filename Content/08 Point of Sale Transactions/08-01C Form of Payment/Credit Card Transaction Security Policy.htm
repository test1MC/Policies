        <h1>Credit Card Transaction Security Policy</h1>
        <p>To prevent credit card fraud, take the following security precautions when completing a credit card transaction:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>NOT APPROVED</b>: Return the card to the customer and ask for another form of payment or void the sale. If the customer has any questions, refer them to their bank.</li>
            <li>Always check the expiration date on the credit card. Do not accept an expired credit card.</li>
            <li>Verify that the signature on the back of the credit card matches the customer's signature on the <b>credit card form</b>.</li>
            <li>If there is a reason to suspect that the credit card is invalid or does not belong to the customer making the sale, ask the customer for positive identification.</li>
            <li>All processed manual forms, including <b>imprinted manual credit card forms</b> and <b>processed manual POST forms</b>, must be retained in a folder titled <b>MANUAL POST FORMS – USED</b> and placed in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe to protect customer information. The processed <b>manual POST form</b> must be retained for 5 years plus the current year. However, the <b>manual credit card imprint</b> may be cross-cut shredded after 18 months.
