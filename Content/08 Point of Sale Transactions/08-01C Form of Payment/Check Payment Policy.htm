        <h1>Check Payment Policy</h1>
        <p>A transaction is considered a <b>check payment</b> whenever a customer uses a <b>Personal Check</b>, <b>Business Check</b>, <b>Travelers Check</b>, or <b>Money Order</b> to pay for merchandise. Some customers use a combination of cash and check to pay for a single purchase.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Employees are not permitted to process their own <b>point of sale transactions</b>. This includes ALL <b>point of sale transactions</b>. Another employee must process the <b>point of sale transaction</b>.</li>
            <li>The check must be made out to <b>The Sherwin-Williams Company</b> - no two-party checks. A <b>Joint check</b> can only be accepted when the <b>Joint Check Job Account policy</b> is followed. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="../08-04A Account Adjustment/Joint Check Agreement Overview.htm">Joint Check  Agreement  Overview</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>The check may not be postdated. The check must be dated the same day as the purchase.</li>
            <li>Employees are not permitted to hold customer checks for future purchases.</li>
            <li>All customer checks must be processed the same day received.</li>

            <li>Stores may not accept checks for any amount over the actual invoice amount resulting in a balance due the customer.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>A customer may write a check over the invoice amount if the resulting balance due the customer is to be applied as a deposit on a future order or processed as a payment on account.&#160; </li>
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1">
                    <li>Note that this will result in a discrepancy in the daily check log, but will not cause a register imbalance.</li>

            </ol>
            <li>Sherwin-Williams employees in all divisions are not permitted to receive cash back from a transaction paid by check. </li>

            <li><b>Temporary New Account Checks</b>: Checks where the Name and Address are not pre-printed should not be accepted without first contacting the bank to verify the account balance. If you are unable to verify account balance, please ask the customer for another form of payment.</li>
            <li><b>Travelers Checks and Money Orders</b>: Process through the computer system using the same guidelines as a personal check. The customer’s signature should be witnessed at the <b>point of sale</b>. Process <b>Traveler's Checks</b> and <b>Money Orders</b> by selecting <b>Check</b> as the <b>Form of Payment</b>.</li>
