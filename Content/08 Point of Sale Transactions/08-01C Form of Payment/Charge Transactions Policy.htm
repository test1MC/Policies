        <h1>Charge Transactions Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Each Sherwin-Williams store has its own charge customers. However, a customer may still charge merchandise at other store locations.</li>
            <li><b>District Credit Manager approval</b> is required to establish customer credit. Credit limits for <b>Sherwin-Williams Charge Accounts</b> are established for each individual account.</li>
            <li>Any charge transaction with a <b>Credit Lock Out</b> must be entered on a customer order once approved by <b>District Credit</b>. The order must be processed on a charge <b>point-of-sale transaction</b> as soon as the account is unlocked.</li>
            <li>Transactions must be processed within 24 hours of delivery after using <b>Customer Order Entry</b> and the <b>Confirmation of Delivery ticket</b>. </li>
            <li><b>EAD, CDN, MWD, SWD</b>:&#160; <b>District Credit Manager approval</b> is required if a customer wishes to charge merchandise to an <b>OVERLIMIT</b> or <b>PAST DUE ACCOUNT</b>.</li>
            <li>Ask to see the customer's <b>Drivers License</b> for any authorized buyer that does not look familiar. Enter the <b>License Number</b> in the <b>Comments Section</b> while processing the transaction.</li>
            <li>Store employees may not provide blank or store documents to anyone.</li>
            <li>Credit policy is circumvented when a store employee uses their personal charge account to charge merchandise for others. This is a conflict of interest and is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. If an employee is found using a personal charge account for others, contact <b>Division Loss Prevention</b>. </li>
            <li>You are required to enter the name of the person signing all <b>Sherwin-Williams Charge</b>. </li>
            <li>The customer's signature is required on all <b>Charge transactions</b>. </li>
            <li>Sherwin-Williams employees are NOT permitted to pre-bill merchandise.</li>
            <li><b>SW Charge Accounts</b> cannot be used with other forms of payment to split orders.</li>
