        <h1>Credit Card Authorization Numbers Procedure</h1>
        <p>When customers change their mind about a purchase or decide on a different form of payment after an authorization against their credit card has been received, it is necessary for the store to contact the <b>credit card company</b> to have the charges released. In the past, unless the sale was completed and the receipt printed, the <b>authorization number</b> was unavailable. The <b>authorization number</b> is needed in order to have the charges against the credit card released.  To view <b>credit card authorization numbers</b>, use <b>INQUIRY [F4]</b>. </p>
