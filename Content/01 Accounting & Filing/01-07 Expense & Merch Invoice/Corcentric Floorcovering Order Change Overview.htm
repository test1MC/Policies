        <h1>Corcentric Floorcovering Order Change Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Floorcovering vendors</b> are able to convert the unit of measure to agree with the purchase order either on the <b>EDI invoice</b> or for <b>non-EDI vendors</b>, on the <b>Corcentric</b> website. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A higher quantity is allowed on the vendors’ invoice to allot for uncut rolls of carpet and other differences in unit of measure between the purchase order and the vendor’s invoice.&#160; </li>
            <li>It is always important when entering the receipt that the quantity reflects exactly what was received, not ordered. </li>
            <li>While creating the <b>floorcovering purchase order</b> make sure that you know the difference between the <b>Vendor</b>, <b>Manufacturer</b> and <b>Distributor</b>. In most cases, the invoice is generated by the <b>Vendor/Manufacturer</b>, not the <b>Distributor</b>. Therefore, the purchase order must be made out to the <b>Vendor/Manufacturer</b>, not the <b>Distributor</b>.</li>
        </ul>
