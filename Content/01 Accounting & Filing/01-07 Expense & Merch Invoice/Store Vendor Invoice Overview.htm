        <h1>Store/Vendor Invoice Overview</h1>
        <p>Vendors will be able to log into <b>Corcentric</b> to see if an invoice is unmatched or matched to a store generated <b>External Purchase</b>. The vendor is also able to see if the invoice is ready to pay.&#160; In addition, the vendor can view payment remittance information and check numbers. The vendor will also be able to see Purchase Order cancellations, and/or the reason their invoice has not paid. The following chart indicates the follow-up procedure:</p>

        <p>In addition, stores will receive an email report from <b>Corcentric</b> advising when a purchase order has been sent to the vendor and <b>Corcentric</b> has not received an <b>855 Acknowledgement</b> back from the vendor within 24 hours. The vendor will also receive an e-mail reminding them to create the <b>855</b>.</p>
        <p>Note: Invoices will not be removed from the <b>Held Invoice Report</b> until receipts are entered in <b>POS</b>, the vendor corrects the invoice or the invoice is deleted, if appropriate. Questions about the <b>Corcentric</b> process can be directed to <b>Debbie Brucato</b> at <b>216-566-3871</b>.</p>
