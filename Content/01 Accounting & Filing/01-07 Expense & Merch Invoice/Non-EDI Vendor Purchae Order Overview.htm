        <h1>Non-EDI Corcentric Purchase Order Overview</h1>
        <p>All orders will be handled through a third-party company named <b>Corcentric</b> regardless of whether the vendor has the EDI system or not. After creating an <b>External Purchase Order</b> to a <b>non-EDI supplier</b>, it will be sent electronically to <b>Corcentric</b> and emailed to the vendor, who is required to create an account on the <b>Corcentric</b> website. Once complete, the acknowledgement will be sent electronically to the store. </p>
