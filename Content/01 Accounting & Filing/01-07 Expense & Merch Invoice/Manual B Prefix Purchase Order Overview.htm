        <h1>Manual B Prefix Purchase Order Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Manual B Prefix Purchase Orders</b> should only be used for the following three scenarios:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>
                        <p>If</p>
                    </th>
                    <th>
                        <p>Then</p>
                    </th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Loss of electrical power and the store computer system is unavailable.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Once the power is available, the <b>Manual B Prefix Purchase</b> <b>Order</b> must be entered into the system. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../07 Merchandise/07-01D2 Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Purchase Order/EDI B Prefix Purchase Order Overview.htm">EDI B Prefix Purchase Order Overview</MadCap:xref>. The store must inform the vendor that they should ship product. This is the only instance that a vendor should ship product on a B prefix purchase order. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Product is shipped that was not on the original purchase order</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>The additional product will go on a <b>Manual B Prefix Purchase Order</b>. In the <b>notes</b> portion, reference the original purchase order number.&#160; The vendor will need to acknowledge the Purchase Order and invoice against this PO. After entering the receipts, if you decide to return the product obtain authorization and a <b>Return Authorization [RA#]</b> from the vendor and then create the <b>Chargeback.</b></p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <p>Receive product directly from a Vendor Sales Rep at your store</p>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Create a <b>B-type purchase order</b> for the product delivered and enter the necessary receipts. The vendor will invoice against the manual purchase order. The purchase order is for billing purposes only; no additional product will get shipped. </p>
                        <p>Note: The <b>manual B prefix purchase order</b> must be entered into the store computer system.
