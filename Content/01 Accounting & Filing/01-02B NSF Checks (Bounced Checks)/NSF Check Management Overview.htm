        <h1>NSF Check Management Overview </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>US locations within the fifty states and <b>Product Finishes facilities</b> will be notified by email through the <strong class="Strong">NSF Check Management System</strong>.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Product Finishes Facilities</b> are set up to have dunning letters automatically sent to writers of <b>NSF checks</b> and the checks are automatically placed for collection. Please contact the <b>Credit Manager</b> for assistance.</li>
            <li>Canadian and US locations outside the fifty states will be notified by fax. </li>
            <li>If the <b>NSF checks</b> are not routed through <b>PNC Bank</b>, the store will be contacted directly by the local bank.</li>
            <li>There is “<b>Bad Data</b>," follow the <b>Update NSF Bad Data Procedure</b>.</li>
            <li>Regardless of division, approximately five to seven days after notification of a returned check, the store should receive the customer’s original check from the <b>Bookkeeping department</b> in Cleveland.</li>
            <li>Upon notification, locations should follow the instructions provided in the email and contact customers by phone to let them know their check was returned. Customers are required to make a payment, including the $10.00-$50.00 <strong class="Strong">Returned Check Fee,</strong> at the location within twenty-four hours by cash, certified check, or money order.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customer checks may not clear for many reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF)</li>
            <li>Account Closed</li>
            <li>Stop Payment placed on the check </li>
            <li>Bad Check Information</li>
            <li>Bad Endorsement</li>
            <li>Suspected Fraud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After PNC bank has attempted to deposit the check two times without success, it will be entered into the<strong class="Strong"> NSF Check Management System</strong>. The <strong class="Strong">NSF Check Management System</strong> features a search option for all NSF check locations in the DAD, reporting options for monitoring NSF checks (paid, unpaid, worthless), and a monthly summary of NSF check recovery performance. This system alerts the store of any NSF checks, provides instructions before collection, and handles the mailing of NSF letters to customers and placing unresolved NSF checks for collection.&#160; </p>
        <p>Respond to emails from the <strong class="Strong">NSF Check Management System</strong> regarding the correction of bad data, recording payment on NSF checks within the system, and logging NSF checks which are reported through local banks and not PNC Bank. Store Managers should review Line 47 of the <strong class="Strong">Store P&amp;L Report </strong>in <strong class="Strong">FactFinder</strong>. If a new NSF Check expense has been entered, open the <strong class="Strong">NSF Check Management System </strong>to ensure the check and customer information are accurate so the collection process can begin. If there is no entry in the<strong class="Strong"> NSF Check Management System</strong>, please email <strong class="Strong">nsfchecks@sherwin.com </strong>to inform them that the store received an NSF notification but there is no entry in the system.&#160; Additionally, Management should review 7510-004 (<strong class="Strong">Collection Fee</strong>), 7510-005 (<strong class="Strong">NSF Check Recoveries</strong>), and 7510-006 (<strong class="Strong">NSF Check Expense- Payment on Account</strong>) in the POS.&#160; Ensure recoveries are entered into the <strong class="Strong">NSF Check Management System</strong> and an 'NSF Fee' is collected. </p>
