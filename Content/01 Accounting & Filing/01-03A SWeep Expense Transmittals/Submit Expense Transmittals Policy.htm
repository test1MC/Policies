            <li>All expense invoices approved by the <b>Store Manager</b> (equal to or less than the approved authorization level) will be automatically routed to <b>Accounts Payable</b> for processing. Any invoice greater than the approved authorization level will be routed to the <b>District Manager</b> for approval. Once the <b>District Manager</b> has approved the invoice, the next person in the approval chain will receive an email to continue the approval process. An approval chain of upper management is automatically built based on the dollar amount and the <b>Division-Area-District</b> location of the store. Once the final person approves the process, the transmittal will be submitted to <b>Accounts Payable</b> for processing.</li>
