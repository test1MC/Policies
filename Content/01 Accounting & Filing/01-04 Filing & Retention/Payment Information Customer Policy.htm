        <h1>Payment Information – Customer Policy</h1>
        <p>Retain all customer payment information in a monthly folder entitled <b>Customer Payment Information</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Any payment information supplied by a customer when you are processing a payment transaction must be retained for one year from the date of the <b>payment transaction</b>. The customer payment information could include the check stub or any other information provided by the customer. It is not necessary to retain a copy of the payment on account transaction in the folder. If you choose to not save a copy of the transaction, please make sure that you are able to quickly reference the transaction information from the <b>customer payment information</b>. At the end of the month, retain the payment information with your monthly batching.</li>
            <li>You must save <b>customer payment information</b> at the store. This information could be used to properly apply payments. Properly applied payments will result in improved collectability of customer accounts as well as reduced past due. DO NOT throw away check stubs or any other information provided by the customer to support their payment on account.</li>
