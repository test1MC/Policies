        <h1>Form Retention Policy</h1>
        <p>You are required to retain a numeric store file for all manual downtime forms both used and unused. Please refer to the following chart. Sort the forms according to the <MadCap:xref href="../01-04B Filing &amp; Retention Schedule/Filing &amp; Retention Batch Box Overview.htm">Filing &amp; Retention Batch Box Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Once validated, all <b>Manual POST forms</b>, including; imprinted manual credit card forms, must be retained in numeric sequence in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe to protect customer information. Staple a copy of the <b>computer generated transaction</b> and <b>credit card form</b> to the completed <b>POST form</b>. Retain the processed forms in a file folder titled <b>MANUAL POST FORMS - USED</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li>Perform a <b>Manual Forms INQUIRY</b> to verify the validation of all manual forms by selecting <b>Store Accountability Inquiry</b> from the <b>INQUIRY Menu</b>. Press <b>ENTER</b> to access the five selections.</li>
