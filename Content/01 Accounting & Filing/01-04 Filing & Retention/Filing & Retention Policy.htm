        <h1>Filing &amp; Retention Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Computer-generated forms for each point of sale must be retained separately for each terminal.</li>
            <li>Each day, month, and year, the <b>Store Manager</b> is responsible for verifying that the forms are retained and filed for the previous day's business. </li>
            <li>At the end of the year, the documents should be moved to a records retention area. Documents are kept in this area for the time period designated on the schedule. <b>For more information see</b>, <MadCap:xref href="../01-04B Filing &amp; Retention Schedule/Filing &amp; Retention Batch Box Overview.htm">Filing &amp; Retention Batch Box Overview</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>If necessary, verify the number of transactions by referencing the <b>Transaction Count report</b> in the <b>REPORTS</b> file. <b>Transaction Count Reports</b> automatically delete after seven days.</li>
            <li>Once validated all <b>Manual POST forms</b> must be retained in numeric sequence. Perform a <b>[Manual Forms INQUIRY]</b> to verify the validation of all manual forms.</li>
            <li><b>DO NOT</b> throw away any <b>copy of a point of sale transaction</b> that is not given to the customer. A copy of every transaction signed by the customer or employee must be retained.</li>
            <li>Every store's filing cabinet(s) should be set up according to the <b>Filing System and Record Retention Schedule</b> and all documents must be retained according to this list.</li>
            <li>Retain all previous years’ documents in covered boxes (gallon paint boxes). Keep all boxed records in a dry clean area. Also, make sure that all boxes are easily accessible.</li>
            <li>Label each box with the contents, the dates of the records, and the date the records will be able to be destroyed. Records that will have the same destroy date should be boxed together. Find the labels in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. Search form name or keyword “<b>filing</b>” in the <b>Form Name</b> field. All available forms containing your search word will appear below in the form description field.</li>
            <li>Three containers should be available to help with your daily batching.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Sales Transactions</li><li>Returns and Corrections</li><li>All Other Transactions</li></ol></li>
            <li>The following day, <b>Sales Transactions</b>, and <b>All Other Transactions</b> will be retained in one <b>Daily Transaction Envelop</b>e. (Daily Transaction Envelope = any envelope) <b>MAKE SURE THAT YOU INCLUDE THE DATE ON THE FRONT OF THE ENVELOPE</b>. These daily envelopes are to be stored in a <b>Batching Box</b> (Batching Box = Any Box).</li>
            <li><b>Return and Correction Transactions</b> are to be stapled to the back of the <b>Return/Correction Register.</b></li>
            <li>Retain <b>customer invoices</b> in a folder entitled <b>MAIL TO CUSTOMER</b> if your customer is not on central invoicing and requests that you mail invoices. Invoices must be mailed at least once a week. If you are required to mail an invoice copy to your customer, be sure to select <b>[Prefers Laser]</b> on the customer <b>Price Record Card.</b></li>
