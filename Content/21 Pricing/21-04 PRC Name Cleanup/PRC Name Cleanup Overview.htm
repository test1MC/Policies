        <h1>PRC Name Cleanup Overview</h1>
        <p>To facilitate <b>E-Commerce orders</b>, stores are required to clean up <b>Job and Price Record Card (PRC) names</b>. With online ordering, customers will select their account and job account information online, which will prompt their pricing prior to the order being placed.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of a customer’s view for online ordering and pricing, and the bolded text represents the <b>Job number and PRC name</b> that the customer has selected. Because of this visibility and transparency, it is essential to perform a <b>PRC Cleanup</b> so that customers select the correct <b>job number and name</b>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The <b>PRC Cleanup application</b> has been created to expedite this initiative:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The application will only show <b>Jobs and PRCs</b> that need to be reviewed, which includes (1) <b>rollup jobs</b> that are not tied to the <b>TRC system</b>, and (2) <b>PRCs</b> with multiple <b>PRCs</b> on a single job.</li>
            <li>An automated system cleanse will name all <b>Job (1) /Card (1) accounts</b> as <b>Main Account</b>, and <b>jobs with only one PRC</b> will have matching names.</li>
            <li>Remember that <b>Job and PRC names</b> will be visible to your customer, so they need to be meaningful and business appropriate.&#160;</li>
        </ul>
