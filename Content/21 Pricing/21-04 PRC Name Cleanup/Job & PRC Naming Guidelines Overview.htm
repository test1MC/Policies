        <h1>Job &amp; PRC Naming Guidelines Overview</h1>
        <p>Adhere to the following guidelines when selecting <b>Job and PRC names</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use business appropriate names</li>
            <li>Each <b>Job and PRC name</b> should have meaning to the customer so that they can remotely identify the appropriate one</li>
            <li><b>PRC names</b> with just numbers should not be used unless they have specific meaning to the customer</li>
            <li>Naming a <b>Job or PRC</b> with “Split XXXX” should not be used because it is not relevant to the customer</li>
            <li><b>Job and PRC names</b> for an account need to be unique—you cannot have two or more <b>PRCs or Jobs</b> on the same account with the same name</li>
            <li>If there is only one <b>PRC</b> tied to a job, the <b>PRC</b> will have the same name as the job</li>
            <li><b>PRC names</b> should have no reference to <b>PRC</b> in the name</li>
            <li>Do not leave <b>PRC name</b> blank</li>
            <li>Delete <b>PRCs</b> once they are no longer necessary</li>
            <li>Contact your <b>District Credit Office</b> to delete <b>Jobs</b> if they are no longer needed</li>
        </ul>
