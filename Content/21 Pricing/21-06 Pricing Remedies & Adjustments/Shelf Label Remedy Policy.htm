        <h1>Shelf Label Remedy Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>If the scanned price at the time of sale is higher than either the <b>shelf price</b> or the advertised price at the time of sale, the customer will immediately receive the lower price upon notification of the error.</li>
            <li>Customers have thirty (30) days from the date of the original transaction to notify Sherwin-Williams of price discrepancies between charged price (displayed on customer receipt) and <b>shelf label pricing</b> or advertised pricing at time of the original sale.&#160; </li>
            <li>Claims of pricing errors within 40% of the current list price of paints and 30% of the current list price of brushes, rollers, and associated products on the date of the claim will be refunded with proof of purchase (receipt). Adjustments above these percentages require <b>District Manager approval</b>.</li>
            <li>An adjustment to <b>promotional pricing</b> outside of promotion dates is not permitted.</li>
            <li>Sherwin-Williams stores are also subject to additional state requirements regarding the handling of scanned price errors.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li><b>MICHIGAN ONLY</b>: If a scanning error is not corrected at the time of purchase, customers are also entitled to a bonus payment in addition to a refund of the difference between the displayed price and scanned (charged) price. This bonus amount should be equal to 10x the difference in price. However, this bonus amount&#160;can never be less than $1.00 nor more than $5.00. In order to receive the bonus payment, the customer must notify Sherwin-Williams within thirty (30) days from the date of purchase and provide their receipt. Sherwin-Williams must refund the difference between the charged and the advertised or <b>shelf label price</b> and pay the bonus amount to the customer within two (2) days of notification. In addition, the bonus payment can only be applied once per unique sales <b>SKU</b> in a transaction. At this time, bonus payments can only be paid in cash. (<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" start="1"><li>For example: Customer buys two of the same brush.&#160;<b>Shelf Label</b> reads $10. Customer Charged $11. Customer is owed the difference of $1 per brush for a total of $2. In addition, a bonus payment of $5 is required. 10x the difference of $1 is $10, but the cap on the bonus payment is $5 and the bonus payment can only be applied to a single instance of the item.</li></ol></li>
