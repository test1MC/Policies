        <h1>Customer Account Classification (CAC) Codes Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Customer Account Classification (CAC) Codes</b> are used to classify customers into groups that have the same focus, interests, and who, most likely, would use the same type of Sherwin-Williams products. Sherwin-Williams can focus advertising and promotions to these select groups of customers when they are properly classified.</p>
        <p><strong class="Strong" style="font-weight: normal;">For example</strong>: <b>CAC #6513 "Residential Building Managers"</b> may offer a <b>ProBuy (special pricing)</b> for such products as <b>Pro-Mar 700</b>, base grade apartment replacement carpet, select wallcovering, and the appropriate associated products related to paint, floorcovering, and wallcovering. If your residential building account is not coded to <b>CAC #6513</b>, they would receive neither the <b>ProBuy mailing</b> advertising the specials nor the <b>special pricing</b> when purchasing.</p>
