        <h1>Holidays Overview</h1>
        <p>The standard holidays are automatically loaded into <b>Kronos</b> for consideration in <b>scheduling</b> and inclusion in <b>payroll</b>. Employees will automatically receive <b>holiday hours</b> for these standard holidays. The divisions will notify you of holidays and any shortened operational hours before the start of the next year. The need may arise to meet special state holidays. When your <b>District Manager</b> informs you of a designated local personal, each employee will automatically receive the appropriate number of <b>holiday hours</b>.&#160;In some locations (excluding Canada), <b>personal holidays</b> may be designated to match local holidays. In these instances, your <b>District Manager</b> will inform you of this decision.</p>
        <p>For details on holidays and truncated store hours, see <MadCap:xref href="../../19 Store Computer (POS) Basics/19-11 Store Hours/Store Hours Overview.htm">Store Hours Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
