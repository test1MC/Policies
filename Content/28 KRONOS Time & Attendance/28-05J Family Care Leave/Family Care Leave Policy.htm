        <h1>Family Care Leave Policy</h1>
        <p>In the event of the serious illness or injury of a spouse, child, or parent, an employee may need time off work to provide care for the seriously ill or injured person. <b>Management</b> will comply with the federal <b>Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</b>, and any state laws governing such <b>leaves of absence</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>With proper documentation, <b>management</b> will consider approving a request for unpaid <b>leave of absence</b> for up to twelve (12) weeks, or the amount of time required by state law whichever is greater, for a regular full-time or part-time employee, who meets the eligibility requirements of <b>FMLA</b> or any state law, and who requests a <b>leave</b> due to the serious illness or injury of a spouse, child, or parent.</li>
            <li>A request for a <b>Family Care Leave</b> of less than thirty (30) calendar days can be granted with the approval of the <b>District Manager</b> and the <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b>.</li>
            <li>A request for a <b>Family Care Leave</b> of thirty (30) or more calendar days requires the approval of the <b>District Manager</b>, <b>Division VP of Human Resources</b>, and the <b>Corporate Employee Benefits Department</b>.</li>
            <li>Requests for a <b>Family Care Leave</b> must be communicated to the <b>Division HR Administrator</b>, who will provide the required documentation to be completed and returned. Failure to contact the <b>Division HR Administrator</b>, and/or complete and return the required documentation, will jeopardize the employee’s employment status with Sherwin-Williams.</li>
            <li>An employee, who returns to work from an approved <b>Family Care Leave of Absence</b>, will return to the same job he/she held prior to the leave unless the position has been eliminated during the employee's <b>absence</b>. </li>
            <li>If the position was eliminated, the employee will have the same rights upon notification of return to work that he/she would have had at the time the job was eliminated.</li>
            <li>An employee who is on an approved <b>Family Care Leave of Absence</b> will continue to participate in the <b>Group Life Insurance Plan</b> at no cost to the employee and the <b>Health Care and Dental Insurance Plans</b> as long as the employee pays the appropriate monthly premium.</li>
