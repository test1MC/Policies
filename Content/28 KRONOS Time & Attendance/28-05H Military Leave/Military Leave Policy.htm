        <h1>Military Leave Policy</h1>
        <p>The Sherwin-Williams Company will comply with all Federal and State laws relating to the treatment of employees who serve in the <b>United Sates Armed Forces</b> (including the <b>National Guard</b>) and the <b>Canadian Forces</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Both regular full-time and regular part-time employees will be given a <b>leave of absence</b> for the purpose of <b>military service</b>, including temporary active duty call up or training (whether voluntary or involuntary) as the result of serving in the <b>military reserves</b> or <b>National Guard</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>leave of absence</b> will not exceed four years unless the employee voluntarily serves another year at the request and convenience of the government, or serves involuntarily, in which case the <b>leave of absence</b> will be extended by one year.</li>
            <li>To be entitled to re-employment rights following a regular tour of duty in the military, the employee must have left active employment as a regular full-time or part-time employee and must have been honorably discharged and have notified the Company of his/her intention to return within ninety (90) days following discharge.</li>
            <li>In the case of a temporary call up or training, the period of <b>leave of absence</b> will include necessary travel time and delays in returning caused by factors beyond the employee's control. Otherwise, the employee must report to work at the "beginning of the next regularly scheduled working period" following the conclusion of such call up or training.</li>
            <li>When practical, employees are expected to give reasonable advance notice in writing and provide some form of verification of <b>military or National Guard duty</b> to their supervisor.</li>
            <li>Employees will not be required to use <b>vacation</b> to cover temporary active duty call up or training unless such call up or training coincides with a standard <b>vacation</b> shutdown.</li>
            <li>The period of <b>leave of absence</b> will be without pay, except that regular full-time employees will be paid their normal biweekly salary, minus military pay, for a period of temporary active duty call up or training, not to exceed two weeks. Such employees will be required to furnish evidence of the amount of military pay received, which must be forwarded to <b>Corporate Payroll</b>.</li>
            <li>Employees who are absent for the purpose of <b>military service</b>, upon return to active employment, will receive a pay rate commensurate with any appropriate pay increases they would have received were it not for the <b>military service absence</b>.</li>
            <li>An employee cannot "voluntarily" extend a leave when there is no requirement that he complete an entire training program at one time. Where there are options and the entire training program will take an extended time period, the employee must discuss the options and take a training schedule reasonable both to his/her own obligations and the company's legitimate concerns.</li>
            <li>Upon return to active employment, the employee shall have the benefits he/she would have enjoyed had it not been for the <b>military service</b>.</li>
            <li>In the event of call up during a time of war or pending war, the company may provide additional benefits.</li>
