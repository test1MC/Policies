        <h1>Kronos Availability Overview</h1>
        <p>Before <b>Kronos</b> can create a <b>schedule</b>, <b>Kronos</b> needs information about when employees work: <strong class="Strong">availability </strong>and <strong class="Strong">patterns</strong>.&#160; These functions should be set once and maintained infrequently.</p>
        <p><strong class="Strong">Availability</strong> is the knowledge of when your employees can and cannot work. <strong class="Strong">Availability </strong>allows you to indicate to <b>Kronos</b> when an employee could be scheduled to work.&#160; When the <strong class="Strong">scheduler </strong>runs in <strong class="Strong">Kronos</strong>, employees will be scheduled to meet the <strong class="Strong" style="font-weight: normal;">demand forecasted</strong> by <b>Kronos</b> but only at times matching their <strong class="Strong">availability</strong>. <strong class="Strong">Availability</strong> is a generality and only means that an employee could be <strong class="Strong">scheduled</strong> during their <strong class="Strong">available</strong> time, not that they will be. If an employee has a non-repeating <strong class="Strong">exception</strong> to their <strong class="Strong">availability</strong>, do not change the <strong class="Strong">base availability</strong>; handle this with a <strong class="Strong">time-off request</strong> for <strong class="Strong">Unavailable</strong>.&#160;For more information on <strong class="Strong">time-off requests</strong>, see <MadCap:xref href="../28-05A Time-Off Requests/Time-Off Request Overview.htm">Time-Off Request Overview</MadCap:xref>. <strong class="Strong">Kronos</strong> will default <strong class="Strong">availability</strong> to “all the time” during <strong class="Strong">store hours</strong> for employees; a manager will need to define the <strong class="Strong">unavailable</strong> times in the system for an employee.</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;<strong class="Strong">Availability</strong> is not when an employee would prefer to work.&#160;For example, “Bob” may have classes at the local college on Tuesday and Thursday, work another job on Friday and Saturday nights, and want to watch the game with his friends on Sunday afternoon.&#160; “Bob” is unavailable to work while in class or at his second job and that should be reflected in availability.&#160; However, his Sunday leisure is a preference which all employees would like and is not something which should be reflected in <strong class="Strong">availability</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong class="Strong">Availability </strong>should be set for the following employees:</p>

            <thead>
                <tr>
