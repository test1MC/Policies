        <h1>Disability Leave Policy</h1>
        <p>An employee (either full-time or part-time) who is too ill or injured to work will be excused provided the employee properly reports such <b>disability</b>, stays in touch with the <b>Store Manager</b> or <b>Assistant Manager</b>, and responds to the <b>Division Human Resource Department's request for information</b>. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Regular full-time employees may be eligible for pay under the terms of the <b>short and/or long-term disability plans</b>. </li>
            <li>Regular part-time employees are not eligible to participate in the <b>short or long-term disability plans</b>. A regular part-time employee who is too ill or injured to report to work will be excused without pay. After twelve (12) weeks of absence, (or a length or <b>absence</b> equal to the amount of service the employee had at the commencement of the <b>absence</b>), whichever is less, such part-time employee will be terminated. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Such terminated employee would be considered for rehire if he/she again applied for employment with Sherwin-Williams.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Employees (both full-time and part-time) who are absent for three (3) or more consecutive workdays will be required to furnish a medical release to return to work. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>The release must state whether the employee can return with or without restriction. </li>
                <li>If the employee has a restriction, the release must indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent restriction.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Employees who are frequently absent due to illness may be required to furnish medical evidence, even though the <b>absences</b> are less then five consecutive days. Such employees may become subject to discipline for excessive absenteeism.</li>
            <li>In addition to the policies surrounding employment status:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>If an employee who is absent on an <b>approved Disability Leave of Absence</b> fails to comply with management's request for information, or does not return to work when released to do so by his/her attending physician, the employee will be considered to have "quit". An employee who is unable to return to work by the expiration of the <b>leave of absence</b> will be terminated as <b>Physically unable to return to Work by End of Disability LOA</b>.</li>
                <li>If the disabled employee is unable to return to work after twelve (12) weeks of <b>absence</b>, he/she will be required to furnish a current medical report which reflects the doctor's professional opinion regarding the employee's probability of returning to work, whether or not the employee will have any work restrictions, and an estimated return date if known.</li>
                <li>If the probable return to work date is "indefinite" or more than 30 days from the date the medical report is received, the disabled employee's former position will be filled by a regular full-time employee, and the disabled employee so notified.</li>
                <li>When an employee returns to work following an approved <b>Disability Leave of Absence</b>, if the employee was absent more than one year, the employee's <b>Service Date</b> will be adjusted forward by the period of <b>absence</b> over one year. If the employee was absent less than one year, the employee's <b>Service Date</b> will not be adjusted.</li>
