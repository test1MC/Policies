        <h1>Kronos Schedule Edits Help </h1>
        <p><b>Kronos</b> will generate a <b>schedule</b> based on factors surrounding store hours, employee information, and labor demand.&#160;For more information on how the <b>schedule</b> is generated, see <MadCap:xref href="../28-03C Suggested Schedule/Kronos Auto Scheduler Overview.htm">Kronos Auto Scheduler Overview </MadCap:xref>. <b>Kronos</b> will only generate to the <b>hours forecasted</b> (these will be less than your <b>target hours</b>).&#160; Do not delete the <b>Kronos generated schedule</b> and start over.&#160;Edit the <b>schedule</b> to achieve the desired results.&#160;Editing suggestions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that all employees have their minimum required hours.</li>
            <li>Validate that all <b>keyholder shifts</b> have been filled.</li>
            <li>Add any shifts that were not previously requested through <b>time-off requests</b>&#160;required to manage special events such <b>meetings, training, and working outside of the store (sales calls, etc)</b>.</li>
            <li>Fill any holes in the <b>schedule</b> where you or <b>Kronos</b> thinks extra staff is required; <b>Kronos</b> will even identify <b>open shifts</b> for the store based on where additional coverage may be required.</li>
            <li>Ensure <b>target hours</b> are met.</li>
            <li>If there are <b>unscheduled exceptions</b> to an employee’s general <b>availability</b> and a conflict exists, remove the conflict by editing the shift or re-assigning the shift.</li>
            <li>Add <b>borrowed employees</b> to the <b>schedule</b>.</li>
            <li>Once all edits have been made, confirm all store hours are appropriately covered and review the <b>Rule Violations tab</b> (bottom left of the screen) to address any <b>over/under scheduling</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before editing the <b>schedule</b>, a few tips and tricks you will want to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type <b>P</b> after <b>Start/End times</b> to indicate PM.&#160;Otherwise, the system defaults to AM. </li>
            <li>Anytime you make a change, save the <b>schedule</b> and refresh your view so that you do not lose your work and you are reviewing the most current view of your <b>edited schedule</b>.</li>
            <li>In the <b>automated schedule</b>, <b>Kronos</b> will suggest break times for employees. For all states (other than California), these breaks are suggestions of when an employee should take a <b>meal break</b> in relation to anticipated demand. The employee does not need to take their break at this time and what appears on the schedule will not affect payroll.</li>
            <li>In California, breaks are scheduled according to the <b>meal break laws</b> and employees should take their breaks as scheduled in <b>Kronos</b> to ensure we are in compliance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once the <b>schedule</b> is finalized, post the <b>schedule</b> electronically and print a copy to post in the store.&#160;Fore more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../28-03E Schedule Posting/Schedule Posting Overview.htm">Schedule Posting Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
