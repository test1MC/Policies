        <h1>Time-Off Request Overview</h1>
        <p>Managing <b>time-off</b> in <strong class="Strong">Kronos</strong> is a fully integrated process.&#160;Employees make requests which are approved (or denied) by <b>management</b>.&#160;If approved, the <strong class="Strong">request</strong> <b>for time-off</b> will be automatically added to the <strong class="Strong">schedule</strong> and automatically added to the <strong class="Strong">timecard</strong>. Employees should be encouraged to submit <strong class="Strong">time-off requests</strong> as soon as possible so that this information can help create the best <strong class="Strong">schedule</strong> for the store and save managers extra steps in processing an <b>ad hoc request</b> and re-posting a <strong class="Strong">schedule</strong> during a <strong class="Strong">pay period</strong>.</p>
        <p>Employees are able to request <b>time-off</b> for:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Vacation</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Personal days</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Jury duty</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Excused time off without pay </li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Local sick time <span style="font-weight: normal;">(where available)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Managers will handle the following requests directly on an employee’s <strong class="Strong">timecard</strong> as employee’s cannot request these types of <b>time-off</b>:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Disability <span style="font-weight: normal;">(sick days)</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Funeral leave</li>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Excused paid time off</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When employees request <strong class="Strong">time-off</strong>, they can let the system know whether or not they want to be <strong class="Strong">available</strong> or <strong class="Strong">unavailable</strong> to work that day.&#160;For example, if an employee wants to take a half day of <b>vacation</b> and be scheduled to work the other part of the day, they would choose to request <b>vacation time</b> and be <b>available</b> to work.&#160;If the employee wants to take a <b>vacation day</b> and not be scheduled, they would choose to request <b>vacation time</b> and be <b>unavailable</b> to work.&#160;Note that even if the employee chooses to be <b>available</b> along with their <b>time-off request</b>, this does not guarantee they will be scheduled.</p>
