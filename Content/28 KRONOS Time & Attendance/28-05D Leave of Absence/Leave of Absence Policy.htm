        <h1>Leave of Absence Policy</h1>
        <p><b>Long term absences</b> are absences of five (5) days or more.&#160;Although lengthy <b>absences</b> from work are discouraged, it is recognized that situations can arise which warrant an employee being granted a <b>leave of absence</b> from work. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>Requests for Information</b> - All absences of five days or more require proper documentation as determined by the <b>Division Human Resource Department</b>. An employee who is anticipating the need for a <b>leave of absence</b>, or who experiences a sudden or unpredicted need for a <b>leave of absence</b>, is expected to cooperate with <b>management’s requests</b> for information necessary to make a determination with respect to granting the request. </li>
            <li>Failure to respond to or comply with a request from the <b>Human Resource Department</b> for proper documentation will result in adverse action including discontinuation of disability benefits and possible termination of employment.</li>
            <li><b>Medical Evidence</b> - <b>Management</b> respects an employee's reasonable expectation of privacy regarding a physical or mental health diagnosis, however, certain information is required to determine an employee’s need for a <b>leave of absence</b> or possible reasonable accommodation to be able to return to work.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Medical evidence will be kept confidential and shared only with those <b>management employees</b> who have a need to know.&#160;&#160;An employee’s medical file will be kept separate from the employee’s human resource file.&#160;With the employee's permission, the <b>Human Resource Department</b> may talk with an employee’s health care provider to assure that both the employee's and the company’s best interests are met to the best of management's ability.</li>
