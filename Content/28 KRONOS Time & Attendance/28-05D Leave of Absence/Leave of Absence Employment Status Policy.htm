        <h1>Leave of Absence Employment Status Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>For the first twelve (12) weeks of an <b>absence</b>, a <b>temporary employee</b> may fill the employee's former job. If the employee is absent for less than twelve (12) weeks, the employee will return to his/her former job, provided the he/she can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.</li>
            <li>If the employee was absent for more than twelve (12) weeks and, as a result, his/her former job was filled by a <b>regular full-time employee</b>, the employee will return to the same position at another store within a reasonable commute of the employee's home, if such a position is available and if the employee can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.</li>
            <li>If the employee cannot be placed under "A" or "B," the employee will be placed into any open position in any store that is within a reasonable commute from the employee's home, if the employee can perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>In the event there is more than one open position, the employee would be placed into the most appropriate open position that most closely approximates the employee's former job. Such employee will be given first consideration to return to his/her former position when it becomes available, provided the employee can perform the essential functions of that position with or without reasonable accommodation, either in the employee's original store or another store that is within a reasonable commute of the employee's home store.</li>
                <li>If the employee refuses to return to such an available position, the employee will be considered to have "quit" his/her employment.</li>
                <li>If the employee cannot be placed under "A," "B," or "C," the employee will remain on <b>leave of absence status</b> until he/she can be placed, until the employee becomes employed with another employer, or until the employee's maximum <b>leave time</b> is exhausted; whichever occurs first.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>If an employee who is on an <b>approved leave of absence</b> fails to comply in a timely manner with management's request for medical evidence or other information relative to the employee's employment with the company, his/her employment will be terminated.</li>
            <li>An employee who is on an <b>approved leave of absence</b> and who anticipates engaging in work for himself/herself or another employer, is expected to contact the <b>Division HR Administrator</b> to discuss the situation. Failure to do so may jeopardize the employee’s employment with Sherwin-Williams. </li>
            <li>If an employee, who is on an <b>approved leave of absence</b>, becomes engaged in any type of work, (either for himself/herself or another employer), the employee’s employment with Sherwin-Williams will be terminated. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Before making that determination, <b>management</b> will consider any mitigating circumstances, which might impact that decision (i.e. the employee cannot work for Sherwin-Williams because of a particular restriction which cannot be accommodated, but which might be able to be accommodated at a different occupation). If such employee is receiving <b>short-term disability pay</b> from Sherwin-Williams, such payments may be reduced in accordance with provisions of the <b>Plan</b>.&#160;If such employee is receiving <b>long-term disability benefits</b>, the continuation of <b>long-term disability benefits</b> will be determined by the insurance provider.</li>
