        <h1>Borrowed Employee Overview</h1>
        <p>From <b>Kronos Timestamp</b>, employees are able to fully manage most any special situation including working in a non-home store within their division.</p>
        <p>If an employee is borrowed or loaned, no extra work is required on the part of either <b>store manager</b> in <b>Kronos</b>Employees may log time at any store in their district and will be paid correctly using a store transfer optionUnless the borrowed time was pre-scheduled, managers will need to adjust their borrowed time later (once they return to their home store). Managers will need to create an <b>employee profile</b> and assign an <b>employee number</b> in <b>POS</b> if the <b>borrowed employee</b> will be using <b>POS</b>.</p>
