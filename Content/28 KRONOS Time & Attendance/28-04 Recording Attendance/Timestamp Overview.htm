        <h1>Timestamp Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Timestamp</b> is used to record daily time in, time out, and meal breaks.&#160;All punches are made in real-time (no rounding occurs with employee punches).&#160;If a punch has been missed or made at the incorrect time, employees will not be able to correct their own punches.</p>
        <p><b>Timestamp</b> prompts employees to approve their time on a daily basis in a process called <b>attestation</b>.&#160; If incorrect, employees will not approve and will provide comments to <b>management</b> on what <b>corrections</b> are required. <b>Management employees</b> will be alerted that <b>corrections</b> need to be made to that employee’s <b>timecard</b>. <b>Management employees</b> should review and correct any <b>missed punches</b> or <b>unapproved (employee) timecards</b> on a daily basis. See <b>Alerts, Timecards, </b>and<b> Manage My Department</b> in <MadCap:xref href="../28-06 Manager Alerts/Manager Alerts Overview.htm">Manager Alerts Overview</MadCap:xref> for more information on reviewing and addressing <b>exceptions</b>.</p>
