        <h1>Absence &amp; Tardiness Reporting Policy</h1>
        <p>Failing to properly record an <b>absence</b> or falsifying an <b>attendance and time record</b> are serious policy violations and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. It is Sherwin-Williams' intention to comply with all federal and state laws governing an employee's time away from work, including <b>FMLA</b> and <b>ADA</b>. If it is determined that Sherwin-Williams has inadvertently or unknowingly violated some government regulation with respect to an employee's <b>absence</b>, the situation will be corrected as soon as possible after Sherwin-Williams has become aware of the violation.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>All <b>absences</b> from work for all employees whether full days or partial days must be recorded.&#160; </li>
            <li>Employees must personally report both <b>expected and unexpected absences</b> to a member of <b>management</b> as soon as possible to allow <b>management</b> to properly staff the store.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>If a member of <b>store management</b> cannot be reached, the <b>District Manager</b> should be contacted.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Unless circumstances do not allow the employee to report their own <b>absence</b>, it is not acceptable for someone other than the employee to report an employee’s <b>absence</b>.</li>
            <li>Unless alternate arrangements have been agreed to and documented, an absent employee is expected to contact his/her supervisor every day of the <b>absence</b>.</li>
            <li>Failure to report an <b>absence</b> may result in an <b>unexcused absence</b>. </li>
            <li><b>Three unexcused absences</b> will result in termination. </li>
            <li>Incarceration is considered an <b>unexcused absenc</b>e and will result in termination after three workdays.</li>
            <li><b>Store Management</b> is responsible for entering <b>unworked hours</b> for <b>absences</b> and coding the time appropriately.&#160; </li>
