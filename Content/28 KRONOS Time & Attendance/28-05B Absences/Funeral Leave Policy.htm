        <h1>Funeral Leave Policy<br /></h1>
        <p>Upon the death of a close relative, employees will be given <b>excused time-off</b> in accordance with the following policies.</p>
        <p>It is appropriate for the facility to send, at Company expense, a moderately priced floral arrangement or make a charitable contribution of equal value as an expression of the Company's sympathy; the card should be signed from The Sherwin-Williams Company. The store should make such arrangements through the <b>District Office</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>A close relative is defined as the following immediate family members: spouse, domestic partner,  parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, children of a domestic partner, siblings, and grandparents, in-laws [mother, father, sister, brother] mother-in-law, mother of a domestic partner, father-in-law, father of a domestic partner, sister-in-law, sister of a domestic partner, brother-in-law, brother of a domestic partner, daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law of a domestic partner, son-in-law and son-in-law of a domestic partner. <b>Time off</b> to attend the funeral service of other relatives or non-relatives will be treated as personal business.</li>
            <li>Employees may be required to furnish evidence of the relative's death.</li>
            <li><b>Paid funeral leave</b> is based on the following:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li><b>Regular Full-Time</b>: 3 Days</li>
                <li><b>Regular Part-Time</b>:&#160; Paid for work time lost while attending the funeral not to exceed the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work that day.</li>
                <li>If circumstances warrant (i.e. sudden and unexpected death of a spouse or child, the funeral is being held in a distant city, etc.), the employee may be excused and paid for additional time not to exceed two days, or a total of five consecutive working days. </li>
                <li>These two additional days must be approved by the <b>District Manager</b> or <b>Area Human Resource Manager</b>.</li>
