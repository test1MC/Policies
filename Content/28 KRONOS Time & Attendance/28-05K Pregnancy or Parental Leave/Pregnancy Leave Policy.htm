        <h1>Pregnancy Leave Policy</h1>
        <p>The Sherwin-Williams Company complies with all Federal and State laws regarding the treatment of <b>pregnancy leave of absence</b>. Company policy provides for a <b>pregnancy leave of absence</b> to include a <b>disability leave of absence</b> as well as an <b>unpaid parental leave of absence</b>. </p>
        <p>The length of the <b>pregnancy leave of absence</b> will vary depending on the employee's status as a full-time or part-time employee and the employee's length of service. An employee must return from a <b>pregnancy leave of absence</b> within three months from the delivery date unless the employee continues to be disabled beyond that date. </p>
        <p><b>Full-Time Employee</b>:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>As long as a regular full-time employee is unable to work because of the pregnancy, the employee will receive <b>short-term disability benefits</b> to which she may be entitled.</li>
            <li>When the full-time employee with more than a year of service has been released by the doctor to return to work (normally six weeks following the delivery date), the employee may be approved for up to an additional six (6) weeks’ <b>unpaid Parental Leave of Absence</b>. <b>Total paid and unpaid leave</b> is not to exceed three (3) months from the date of delivery unless employee continues to be disabled beyond that point.</li>
            <li>A full-time employee with less than one year of service may be granted a <b>leave of absence</b> due to pregnancy for a period of time equal to the amount of service the employee had on the first day of the <b>absence</b> due to disability not to exceed three months from the date of delivery. </li>
            <li>If a full-time employee fails to return to work on or before a date that is three months from the date of delivery, the employee's employment will be terminated. </li>
            <li>A full-time employee may continue to participate in the <b>Life Insurance Plan</b> at no cost to the employee and the <b>Health Care Plan</b> as long as she submits the appropriate monthly premium.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Part-Time Employee</b>:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>A part-time employee who must be absent from work due to pregnancy will be excused without pay for up to twelve weeks or a period of time equal to the amount of service the employee had at the commencement of the <b>absence</b>, whichever is less</li>
            <li>If the part-time employee fails to return to work by the end of that period of time, the employee will be terminated.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: A pregnant employee must contact the appropriate <b>Division Human Resource Administrator</b> and complete a <b>Request for Leave of Absence Form</b> early in the pregnancy. When the employee is no longer physically able to work because of the pregnancy, the employee must provide a doctor's statement to that affect.</p>
