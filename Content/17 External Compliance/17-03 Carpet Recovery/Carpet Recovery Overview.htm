        <h1>Carpet Recovery Overview</h1>
        <p>On July 1, 2011, <b>California’s new carpet stewardship law (AB 2398)</b> went into effect. The goal of the program is to promote the re-use and recycling of carpet in an effort to reduce the amount of carpet being discarded into landfills. This program is funded in part by an assessment collected on all carpets sold and/or shipped into California. It is likely that customers will have questions regarding this charge. Inform them that it is the law and that you are required to collect the assessment. <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> simply collects the assessment which it pays to the carpet manufacturer who then forwards it to <b>Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE)</b>. <b>CARE</b> is the carpet stewardship organization administering the program for the state.</p>
        <p> For any questions regarding the scope or effect of the new law, speak with the <b>District Manager</b> or visit <a href="http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov">www.calrecycle.ca.gov</a> or <a href="http://www.carpetrecovery.org">www.carpetrecovery.org</a></p>
