        <h1>Lead Dust Exposure Overview</h1>
        <p>Federal law has prohibited paint manufacturers from producing paints containing lead for architectural or consumer use since 1978. <b>Structures painted prior to 1978 may contain leaded paint</b>.&#160;The removal of old paint by sanding, scraping, or other means may generate dust or fumes that contain lead.&#160; Lead can be toxic.</p>
        <p>The <b>EPA Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting Program Rules</b> effective in 2010 addresses the hazards created by renovation, repair, and painting activities that disturb lead-based paint in target housing and child-occupied facilities.</p>
        <p><b>Target Housing</b> is a home or residential unit built on or before 31 December, 1977 with the following exceptions:&#160; </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Housing designated for the elderly or persons with disabilities [unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing].</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any zero-bedroom dwelling&#160; such as studio apartments, hospitals, hotels, dormitories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <b>Child-Occupied Facility</b> is a building constructed in or before 1978 and may be located in a public or commercial building or within target housing. These facilities include schools, child care facilities, and daycare centers.&#160; For consideration under the <b>EPA Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting Program Rules</b>, the child-occupied facility must meet all three criteria:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Facility is regularly visited by the same child who is under six (6) years of age.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Visits by the child occur on at least two different days within any week (Sunday thru Saturday) and last at least three (3) hours each.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Combined weekly visits last at least six (6) hours and combined annual visits last at least sixty (60) hours.</li>
        </ul>
