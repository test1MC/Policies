        <h1>Local Pricing Audit Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Local audit departments</b> routinely pay surprise visits to our stores to ensure that the <b>Shelf Label pricing</b> matches the list price of products scanned at the register. These audits are critical and protect consumer interests. Stores with violations may be subject to fines and additional audits. All states and local governments have their own regulations concerning <b>Shelf Labels</b>. The <b>Store Manager</b> should check with local authorities to become familiar with local requirements. Stores should always be ready for a pricing audit. Maintain <b>Shelf Label accuracy</b> by utilizing these practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong class="Strong">Cycle Count</strong>: When performing your weekly Cycle Counts, verify that the <b>List Pric</b>e returned in the system matches the <b>Shelf Label pricing</b> for the product.</li>
            <li><strong class="Strong">Pricing Updates</strong>: When notified of pricing updates, remove the <b>old Shelf Labels</b> and either display the <b>new Shelf Labels</b> sent to you from <b>Headquarters</b> or use <b>Shelf Labels On Demand</b> to create <b>new Shelf Labels</b> that reflect the price increase.</li>
        </ul>
