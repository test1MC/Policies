        <h1>Canada - Eco Fees Overview</h1>
        <p>For the last ten years, Canadian Provinces have been looking for ways to decrease the amount of household waste that end up in landfills, waterways, or sewers. In Ontario alone, approximately 95 million liters of architectural paint were sold in 2006 with an estimated 10% becoming leftover paint that ends up in landfills or waterways. In an effort to divert the leftover paint, individual Provinces passed legislation that would require the <b>Steward</b> of the paint product to develop and fund a <b>paint-recycling program</b> or to join an <b>Industry Funding Organization (IFO)</b> that would develop and manage the program, to which the <b>Brand Owner</b> would fund the <b>IFO</b>.</p>
        <p>There are currently ten Canadian provinces that have passed this type of legislation: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan. Four IFO’s operate in Canada:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 9pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Eco Peinture</b> – manages the Quebec program</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Paint Recycling Alberta</b> – manages the Alberta program</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Product Care Association</b> – manages the British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova&#160; Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These <b>IFO’s</b> are responsible for the development of the <b>stewardship program plans</b>.&#160;This includes communications to the public and members, submission of data to government, set up and run household waste drop off points, and determine the fee structures for the Stewards. All of the <b>Eco-fees</b> paid by members of the <b>IFO</b> go to fund the program. <b>The Sherwin-Williams Company (SW)</b> is a member of all of these <b>IFO’s</b>.</p>
        <p>As a Steward, <b>The Sherwin-Williams Company</b> is responsible for paying the appropriate eco fee for the products sold into each province or state. Whether or not this fee is collected from our customers is a business decision that has been left up to the company.&#160; </p>
        <p><i>Note:</i>&#160; As of April 1<sup>st</sup> 2017, <b>Prince Edward Island’s Eco Fees</b> will increase; however, all other provinces’ fees will remain the same. For information specific to each province, see the <a href="http://www.productcare.org/">Product Care</a> website.</p>
