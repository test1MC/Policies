        <h1>RRP – Disturbance of Painted Surfaces Overview</h1>
        <p>In general, <b>EPA</b> believes that activities that create dust or paint chips are activities that disturb paint. There is no definitive list of activities that disturb painted surfaces. Some examples that can disturb painted surfaces include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making cut-outs in walls</li>
            <li>Replacing a window from the inside or outside</li>
            <li>Removing paint with a heat gun</li>
            <li>Scraping paint</li>
            <li>Removing kitchen cabinets</li>
            <li>Removing paint by abrasive sanding</li>
            <li>Removal of large structures, including demolition of interior plaster walls</li>
            <li>Window replacement</li>
            <li>HVAC repair or replacement, including duct work</li>
            <li>Repairs resulting in isolated small surface disruptions, including drilling and sawing into wood and plaster</li>
            <li>Scuff-sanding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These activities and other activities which disturb paint could be relevant to many trades, such as (but not limited to) renovation, remodeling, general repair, general maintenance, plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, window installation, painting, weatherization work, and more.</p>
