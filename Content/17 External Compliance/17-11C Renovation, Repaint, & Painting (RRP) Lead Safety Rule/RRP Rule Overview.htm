        <h1>RRP Rule Overview</h1>
        <p><b>EPA</b>'s <b>Renovation, Repair, &amp; Painting (RRP) program</b> is designed to reduce <b>lead contamination</b> by training contractors in relatively simple lead-safe work practices, and certifying contractors to make sure that they follow <b>lead-safe work practices.</b></p>
        <p>The <b>RRP Rule</b> requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Renovators are trained in the use of lead safe work practices</li>
            <li>Renovators and firms be certified</li>
            <li>Providers of renovation training be accredited </li>
            <li>Renovators follow specific work practice standards </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rule applies to all firms and individuals who are paid to perform renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb paint in <b>pre-1978 housing</b> and <b>child-occupied facilities</b>. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Home improvement contractors</li>
            <li>Maintenance workers</li>
            <li>Painters</li>
            <li>Other trades</li>
        </ul>
