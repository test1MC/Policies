        <h1>PaintCare Recovery Program Overview</h1>
        <p>The following information applies to all <b>TAG locations</b> in participating states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington DC. This information also applies to any <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> location shipping products to participating states.</p>
        <p>The <b>American Coatings Association (ACA)</b> has worked with various stakeholders interested in the management of post-consumer paint to develop and implement an industry led <b>Paint Stewardship Pilot Program</b> in the <b>US</b>. <b>ACA</b> and its new non-profit stewardship organization–<b>PaintCare</b>–are in the process of implementing the program nationwide.</p>
        <p>The Program is entirely funded by the <b>PaintCare Recovery Fee</b> which is paid to <b>PaintCare</b> by the manufacturers based on their architectural paint sales in participating states. <b>PaintCare</b> engages and manages all contracts for collection, transportation, recycling, and proper disposal of Program Products. <b>PaintCare</b> submitted a <b>Program Plan</b> for approval by the <b>Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ)</b> and will submit reports on the Program on an annual basis.</p>
