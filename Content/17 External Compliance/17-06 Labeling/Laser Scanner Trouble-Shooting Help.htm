        <h1>Laser Scanner Trouble-Shooting Help</h1>
        <p>When using the <b>Laser Scanner</b>, store employees may occasionally encounter a number that is not in the system. Products that do not scan and have a <b>SW sales number</b> and a <b>UPC code</b> on the package should be documented on the <b>Universal Product Code – Add Form</b>. Immediate attention will ensure that bar codes remain accurate in the <b>Store Computer System</b>. Mail or fax the completed form to the address displayed on the bottom of the form. Please use a photocopy if additional copies are needed.</p>

                        <p>The <b>Laser Scanner</b> is most beneficial when a customer is purchasing associated products, brushes, and rollers. Choose to scan the paint after it comes out of the shaker or enter the sales number manually while the paint is shaking.</p>
