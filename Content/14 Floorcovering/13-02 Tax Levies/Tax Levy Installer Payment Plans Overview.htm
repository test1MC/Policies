        <h1>Tax Levy Installer Payment Plans Overview</h1>
        <p>Payment plans whereby <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> withholds a portion of each check and forwards it to the taxing authority are generally reserved for employees only; therefore, installers would not normally qualify. Any arrangements for payment plans for <b>carpet installers</b> on an ongoing basis require <strong class="Strong">approval </strong>of the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b>. A store draft on the <b>installer’s IPA account</b> should be made payable to the <b>US Treasury</b> for funds due and should be sent to:</p>
        <p>Sherwin-Williams Company<br />Corporate Tax Department<br />P.O. Box 6027<br />Cleveland, Ohio 44101<br /></p>
        <p>The <b>ID number</b> of the installer should appear in the box at the top of the draft although the draft is made out to the <b>IRS</b>. Any funds paid to the <b>IRS</b> on behalf of an installer are taxable to the installer and those funds will be included in the installer’s <b>1099 form</b> at the end of the year.</p>
