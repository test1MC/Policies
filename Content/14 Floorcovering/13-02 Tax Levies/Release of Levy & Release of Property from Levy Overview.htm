        <h1>Release of Levy &amp; Release of Property from Levy Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>As long as a tax levy has been served on <b>The Sherwin-Williams Company</b>, <b>S-W</b> must comply with it. Do not believe that the installer has “worked this problem out with the IRS" or “it’s another mix-up."&#160; </li>
            <li>Note that by the time the store is called by <b>Bookkeeping</b>, the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b> has sent a copy of the levy to the installer at the address the <b>IRS</b> has supplied to <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>. Because this may or may not ever reach the installer, it is recommended that employees notify the installer of the existence of the <b>tax levy</b> as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>The installer must resolve any tax problems directly with the <b>IRS</b> without involving <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>. It is not resolved until <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> receives a written release of the levy either at the store or in the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b>.&#160; Otherwise, the <b>Store Manager</b> must speak directly with an <b>IRS Agent</b> to obtain a verbal release before any funds can be paid to the installer.</li>
            <li>If funds are due the person named in the levy, first contact the <b>Corporate Tax Department 216-566-2576</b>. Generally, all funds due that person must be paid to the <b>IRS</b>. A store draft on the installer’s <b>IPA account</b> should be made payable to the <b>US Treasury</b> for funds due and should be sent to:</li>
            <p>The Sherwin-Williams Company<br />Corporate Tax Department<br />P.O. Box 6027<br />Cleveland, Ohio 44101<br /></p>
            <li>The <b>ID Number</b> of the person named in the levy should be included on the draft although it is payable to the <b>IRS</b>.</li>
        </ul>
