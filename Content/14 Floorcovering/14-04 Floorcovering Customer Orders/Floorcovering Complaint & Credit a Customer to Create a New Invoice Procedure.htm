                        <p>Note: The <b>ARJV</b> cannot be processed for an amount greater than the installer retainage account. If there is not enough in the account, you will need to have another <b>ARJV</b> processed once the retainage amount is able to cover the balance. Your <b>ARJV</b> must be reconciled monthly against the <b>SVR</b>. An alternative method would be to charge the installer for the products through the <b>POS</b>.</p>
