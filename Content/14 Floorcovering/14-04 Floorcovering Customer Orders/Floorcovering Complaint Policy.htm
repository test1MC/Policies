        <h1>Floorcovering Complaint Policy</h1>
        <p>The key to handling customer complaints is to have a plan and act quickly.&#160;Respond to the customer within 24 hours and agree on a time to inspect. Get your <b>sales rep</b> involved. The <b>sales rep</b> always needs to be aware of the situation so there are no surprises when they visit the customer. Below are the approval limits for floorcovering complaints:</p>
