        <h1>Installer Payment Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>Installer Payments</b> must be processed through <b>Disbursement</b>.</li>
            <li>Each installer must be set up with a special <b>Installer Payment Account</b> prior to making any payment to the installer. Installers with these special accounts will be the only installers that you will be able to pay.</li>
            <li> Set up all <b>Installer Payment Accounts</b> through the <b>District Credit Office</b>. You will need the installer Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Phone Number and <b>Installer Identification Number/Social Security Number</b>. <b>Installer Identification Number/Social Security Number</b> are required when the <b>Installer Payment Account</b> is opened at the <b>District Credit Office</b>.</li>
            <li>A completed <b>Subcontractor Agreement</b>, <b>W-9 Form</b>, <b>Declaration of Liability and Automobile Insurance</b>, and <b>Workers Compensation Insurance</b>, if required by the state. If <b>Workers Compensation</b> is not required, the installer must provide a <b>Workers Compensation exemption form</b> and a <b>Sherwin form</b> located in the <b>IPA packet</b>. This information must be on file at EACH store location that uses the installation services of the installer.</li>
            <li>Open a separate <b>installer charge account</b> for each installer, if approved, for miscellaneous purchases. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Do NOT deduct supplies from the installer’s bill.&#160;Use the approved <b>charge account</b> to handle supplies purchased by the installer.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Installers must submit their invoice to the store before payment can be processed. Installers can add additional charges to the <b>work order</b> for payment.</li>
            <li>Installers are not to be paid prior to installation.</li>
            <li>Installers are not to be paid in full for a job until the job is completed and inspected. If necessary, a <b>partial payment (draw)</b> can be made to the installer for the amount of work completed. Before issuing a partial payment, contact the customer to make sure that the completed portion of work meets their satisfaction.</li>
            <li>&#160;<b>Advanced payment</b> can only be made for the completed portion of installation. </li>
            <li>The <b>partial payment (draw)</b> must reference a current job in process.</li>
            <li>The customer must be satisfied with the completed installation prior to final payment.</li>
            <li>If your <b>installer payment</b> involves a customer settlement in which a second installer is to be paid out of the <b>retainage account</b> of the first installer, do NOT pay the second installer until the <b>retainage amount</b> has been confirmed with the <b>District Credit Office</b>.</li>
            <li>All installer paperwork (including <b>invoices and work order amendments</b>) must be retained per schedule requirements.
