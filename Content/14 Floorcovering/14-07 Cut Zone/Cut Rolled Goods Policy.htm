        <h1>Cut Rolled Goods Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Before a job is physically cut, the system must be checked to make sure the appropriate roll is used.</li>
            <li>Avoid cuts that will result in a less than <b>room size remnant</b>.</li>
            <li>Cuts should NEVER be assigned in the <b>work order</b> until the carpet is actually cut.&#160; </li>
            <li>If you want to designate inventory for a specific order but not cut right away, you may reserve the inventory in <b>COE</b> for the order.&#160;This will earmark the material for the order and not allow it to be selected for other orders or change inventory levels of the <b>parent roll</b>.</li>
