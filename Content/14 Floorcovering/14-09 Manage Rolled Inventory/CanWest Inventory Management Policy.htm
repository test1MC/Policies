        <h1>CanWest Inventory Management Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li><b>CanWest</b> will not accept inventory into their warehouse without the proper paperwork from the manufacturer and/or Sherwin-Williams. Examples of accepted paperwork:&#160;<b>Manufacturer Packing List</b>, <b>SW Purchase Order</b>.</li>
            <li><b>CanWest</b> facilities will recommend reorder points to Sherwin-Williams stores for material to be held at the <b>CanWest</b> facility based on the facility’s knowledge of upcoming jobs and demand.&#160;The <b>Sherwin-Williams manager</b> should take this information into consideration when placing <b>purchase orders</b> with vendors for additional stock to be held at <b>CanWest</b>.</li>
            <li>Once an order is approved by Sherwin-Williams, <b>CanWest</b> will make <b>roll selection</b> for orders from the stock belonging to the store owning the order.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li><b>Roll selection</b> will be made to best minimize waste and to match required dye lots.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>If a store does not have enough stock at <b>CanWest</b> for a job, <b>CanWest</b> may take, with approval from Sherwin-Williams, stock belonging to another SW store.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>SW stores are to respond same day to these requests for approval.&#160; </li>
                <li><b>CanWest</b> should contact the store requiring the inventory and will provide information on the store that has inventory available.&#160; </li>
                <li>The <b>SW manager</b> of the requesting store must obtain approval from the <b>transferring SW store</b> before granting <b>CanWest</b> approval to proceed with the <b>stock transfer</b>.&#160;The store requiring the inventory must place an <b>ISR</b> to the store holding the inventory on the same day that approval is given to <b>CanWest</b>.&#160; </li>
                <li>The store transferring material is required to complete an <b>IST</b>. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Once on site, if the <b>CanWest installer</b> finds the details of a job (labor or material required) to be different from quoted labor or material, they are required to obtain approval from the appropriate Sherwin-Williams store before proceeding with the order.&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>SW stores are to respond same day to these requests for approval.</li>
