        <h1>Night Deliveries Policy</h1>
        <p>If the store has been notified that it is a participant in the <b>night delivery program</b>, the store must adhere to the following policies:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Prior to being placed in the <b>night delivery program</b>, stores must obtain approval from the <b>DSC</b> and <b>Loss Prevention</b>.</li>
            <li> <b>All night delivery locations</b> must be equipped with a <b>burglar alarm</b> and a <b>shunt access key</b> which will allow for drivers to enter through the loading dock or rear entrance. Shunt keys will simultaneously unlock and disarm all or a portion of the alarm for the duration of the delivery.<br />a. <b>Store Managers</b> should contact their divisional <b>Loss Prevention</b> staff for assistance with all alarm service and/or shunt install requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Loading dock</b> and <b>parking lot lighting</b> must be in good condition and provide adequate lighting (between 20-50Lux, or as bright as most street lights) within 75 feet of the dock door.<br />a. All loading dock lighting must be operated via a <b>“dusk to dawn” switch</b> in order to alleviate any potential outages during delivery.&#160; </li>
            <li>Any <b>interior dock areas</b> adjacent to the receiving door(s) must be maintained and free from merchandise that would hinder easy access for unloading the truck.</li>
            <li>Any <b>exterior dock areas</b> adjacent to the receiving door(s) must be maintained so as to not impede the delivery driver. <br />a. <b>Driveways</b> should be clear of any obstruction that would prevent the driver from easily entering/exiting the dock area.&#160; </li>
