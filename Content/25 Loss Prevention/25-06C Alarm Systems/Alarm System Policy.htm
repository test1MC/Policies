            <li>Each <b>Manager</b> should be assigned a <b>confidential passcode</b>.</li>
            <li>Passcodes may not be shared under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>Only the <b>Store Manager</b> and <b>Loss Prevention</b> are allowed to add or delete codes, as well as modify the <b>emergency call list</b> for their location.</li>
            <li>If a <b>Manager</b> leaves the store due to transfer, termination, or steps down to a non-management position, the passcode must be deleted immediately with the <b>alarm vendor</b>.</li>
            <li>When using a <b>borrowed Manager</b>, contact the <b>alarm vendor</b> 24 hours in advance to receive a <b>temporary passcode</b>.</li>
            <li>If at any point it is suspected that the passcode has been compromised, contact the <b>alarm vendor</b> immediately to have the old passcode canceled and a new passcode issued.</li>
