        <h1>Audit Responses Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of obtaining management responses is to:<ul><li><p>Provide a more proactive audit approach, where managers have a complete understanding of the proper way to resolve identified audit exceptions.</p></li><li>Provide management with a final product in a more timely manner.</li><li>Increase communication between the auditor and store/district personnel throughout the audit process.</li></ul>You should be interacting with your auditor daily in order to take time throughout the audit process to discuss and review the topics that they have covered each day. During this time you should begin to think about the steps that should be taken to resolve the current problems and how to prevent any future occurrences.</li>
            <li>Once you have determined the best approach to resolve the audit infraction the Manager will need to provide the auditor with a daily written response for all items discussed so that the <b>Closing Conference</b> is a simple review of the topics reviewed during the audit. The written response should be prepared with the <b>District Manager</b> as the target audience. Each response should be proactive to show how the problem will be resolved and future occurrences prevented.</li>
            <li><b>Final Audit Reports</b> will be issued with <b>Management responses</b> for review by <b>Stores Group or Division Management</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Audit Responses are required to be obtained at the time of the audit. If responses are not as outlined per policy, the auditor may contact the District Manager to involve them in the process. District Managers are no longer required to send a cover letter with the copy of the audit to Stores Group or Division Management Stores Group and Division Executives are able to review all audits on the SOURCE Intranet.</p>

                        <p>The shipment came in on 5/07/04 with two other trucks with a total of 15 pallets. There were only three employees working that day with one on the road, only leaving two in the store. With one employee unloading the truck only leaves one other employee up front helping customers. When I was finished unloading the truck, I went up front and there were about 10 customers waiting. All I did was lock the spray equipment. We did over $7,000 that day, and customer service is number 1. Over the weekend the employees logged the spray equipment pieces into the spray log. On 5/11/04 the same thing happened. We did over $7,100 with two employees in the store with one on the phone. Both days we had lunch at 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. We ordered at noon and ate at 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. On 5/12/04 we only did about $4,000, which was when we put the two pieces of equipment into the system.</p>
