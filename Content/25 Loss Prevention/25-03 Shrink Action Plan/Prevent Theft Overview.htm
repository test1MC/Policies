        <h1>Prevent Theft Overview</h1>
        <p>Although the <b>Shrink Action Plan</b> is intended for priority stores, all employees&#160; should follow these guidelines in order to prevent theft:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Greet every customer</b> that enters the store. This helps let customers know you are aware of their presence. Your greeting should include phrases such as “one of us will be with you shortly” or “how can we help you?” The use of the collective <b>“we”</b> suggests there may be more than one person in the store.</li>
            <li>Make yourself available to all customers and be attentive to their needs. Try to limit the amount of time you leave the sales floor unattended.</li>
            <li>Approach <b>suspicious persons</b> and ask if they are finding everything okay. Mention that you’ll be nearby should they need a helping hand.</li>
            <li>Place small, easy to conceal, expensive items in <b>locked cabinets</b> or <b>behind the counter</b>.</li>
            <li>Keep the store <b>neat and orderly</b>. Full displays and straightened shelves allow employees to see at a glance if something is missing or out of place.</li>
            <li>Place <b>high ticket/theft items</b> away from the door so they are not easy to grab and exit.</li>
            <li>Train all employees on how to be aware of, and respond to, potential shoplifters.</li>
            <li>Ensure that all <b>non-customer doors</b> remain locked and/or the use of accordion doors is in place.</li>
            <li>If <b>door chimes</b> are not functioning, they should be repaired immediately.</li>
            <li>Be aware what is being refunded and by whom. Unusual items and multiple returns by the same customer should be reviewed and, if necessary, passed on to <b>Loss Prevention</b>. The policy that requires proof of purchase to return merchandise deters shoplifting.</li>
            <li>Report all <b>shoplifting incidents</b> to <b>Loss Prevention</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Managers</b> should be working a variety of hours. Learn your customers and increase <b>employee engagement</b> during <b>non-traditional business hours</b>.</li>
            <li>When in the area, <b>District</b> and <b>Store Management</b> should stop by unexpectedly. This will give you a true understanding of what is happening when you’re not there.</li>
        </ul>
