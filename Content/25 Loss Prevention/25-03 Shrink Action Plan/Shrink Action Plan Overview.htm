        <h1>Shrink Action Plan Overview</h1>
        <p>This program is designed to help stores reduce overall shrink, improve profit, and store performance. This will be a collective effort to drive down shrink and grow profit; however, it begins with management and  store staff. </p>
        <p>After <b>priority stores</b> are selected based upon their <b>cumulative inventory results</b>, a plan will be established to help ensure that appropriate <b>inventory controls</b> are in place to assist in reducing <b>inventory variances</b>. A store meeting with the entire staff will need to be held to discuss this program. When possible, <b>Loss Prevention</b> or the <b>District Manager</b> will attend the meeting to provide guidance and/or answer questions, as well as perdiocally check on the program’s progress. The <b>shrink summary</b> will be completed by <b>Loss Prevention</b> during the implementation of this plan.</p>
        <p>For any questions regarding this program or inventory, please do not hesitate to call the <b>divisional leadership team</b>, including the <b>Director or Manager of Loss Prevention</b>, the <b>District or City Manager</b>, or the <b>local Auditor</b>.</p>
