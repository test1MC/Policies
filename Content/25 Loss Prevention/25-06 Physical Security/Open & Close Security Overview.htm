        <h1>Open &amp; Close Security Overview</h1>
        <p>In order to ensure <b>employee safety</b> and discourage theft or robbery, employees should follow these practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two or more people should arrive at the store at approximately the same time and enter the store together.</li>
            <li>Employees should note any strangers or vehicles in the area. If they suspect <b>suspicious activity</b>, employees should not enter the store, but rather, notify the <b>local police department</b> immediately.</li>
            <li>The perimeter of the store should be checked for signs of <b>illegal entry</b> such as windows or doors left ajar, broken glass, etc. If signs of illegal entry are found, the employees should notify the local police immediately.</li>
            <li>Once in the store, turn off any <b>alarms</b> and conduct a thorough investigation of the premise by observing the lights, ensuring the safe has not been tampered with, and that no merchandise has been removed from the store. </li>
            <li>If a <b>break-in</b> has occurred, contact the police immediately, then notify the <b>District Manager</b> and <b>Division Loss Prevention</b>.</li>
            <li>At night, employees should not count the money on the <b>Point of Sale Wrap Counter</b> in plain view of the store's windows. Count all currency and checks in the <b>Manager's Office</b>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../19 Store Computer (POS) Basics/19-02D POS Close &amp; End of Day/Close Policy.htm">Close Policy</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li>Prior to the final exit from the store, a member of management should check to ensure that all customers and employees have left the store.</li>
            <li>A final check of the <b>cash drawer</b> should be made to see that all the money had been placed in the safe and/or bank deposit.</li>
            <li>If the store has an alarm, it should be set and checked to ensure that it is working properly.</li>
            <li>All doors should be locked and the person responsible for the <b>Close (keyholder)</b> should ensure that all employees are safely in their cars prior to leaving.</li>
        </ul>
