        <h1>Physical Security Overview</h1>
        <p><b>The Sherwin-Williams Company</b> is concerned with the security of its stores' premises and merchandise. Security involves protecting the <b>company's personnel and physical assets</b>, including: money, merchandise, equipment, supplies, records and confidential information. The cost of <b>theft</b> and <b>vandalism</b> to the company can be enormous. <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> relies on the honesty and integrity of its employees to help safeguard the company's assets.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure that all aspects of the physical security (e.g. alarm systems, access control, panic /push bar alarms, locks, cores, keys, safes/locking file cabinets and off-site storage facilities) are functioning properly, they must be inspected on a consistent basis.&#160; Although specific security measures may differ according to the floor plans or operations conducted at the site, there are similarities in our operations where these guidelines can be universally applied:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain building security by keeping all <b>warehouse windows</b> locked at all times and ensure that the <b>back door</b> of the warehouse cannot be opened from the outside.</li>
            <li>Keep all windows and doors in good repair to help prevent <b>break-ins</b>. </li>
            <li>Do not keep any copies of the <b>safe combination</b> anywhere in the store.</li>
            <li>When an employee authorized to know the safe combination leaves employment at the store (termination, promotion) and does NOT return their key to the store, follow the <MadCap:xref href="../25-06A Lock &amp; Key Control/Lost &amp; Unreturned Keys Procedure.htm">Lost &amp; Unreturned Keys Procedure</MadCap:xref> to have the core replaced. Post <b>police and fire emergency numbers</b> next to the store's telephones.</li>
            <li>Install a <b>buzzer</b> at the rear entrance for deliveries. Have chimes at the front door to signal when a customer enters the store. </li>
            <li>Ensure all <b>skylights</b> and <b>air conditioning vents</b> are secure.</li>
        </ul>
