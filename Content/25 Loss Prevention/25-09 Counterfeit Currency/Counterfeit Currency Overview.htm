        <h1>Counterfeit Currency Overview</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Counterfeit currency is forged currency that is made to imitate genuine currency. It is produced without legal sanction of the government. Since it is a serious crime to produce counterfeit currency, banks will not accept or reimburse businesses that accidentally accept counterfeit currency. Therefore, suspected counterfeit currency should not be accepted as a form of payment in any sales transaction. </p>
