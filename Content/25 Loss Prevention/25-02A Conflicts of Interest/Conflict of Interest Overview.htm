        <h1>Conflict of Interest Overview</h1>
        <p>A <b>conflict of interest</b> may arise in many situations. Although it is not possible to identify all situations which could involve a conflict of interest, reasonable business judgment should be sufficient to evaluate most situations.</p>
        <p>Some common situations which involve potential or actual conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The<b> acquisition or ownership</b> of any stocks, bonds, notes, or other financial instruments or obligations of any company that is a competitor, vendor, or customer of Sherwin-Williams. This situation does not apply to the <b>acquisition or ownership of nominal holdings of securities</b> or other obligations of a company whose securities are <b>publicly traded</b>.</li>
            <li>Maintaining <b>outside employment</b> with or providing consulting services to any competitor, vendor, or customer of Sherwin-Williams.</li>
            <li>Soliciting, demanding, or accepting gifts, gratuities, prizes, trips, favors, goods, services, or anything of value, or the giving of gifts, gratuities, prizes, trips, favors, goods, services or anything of value, from or to any person in conjunction with the performance of your duties and responsibilities with <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>. The acceptance and offer of gifts of nominal value and normal business courtesies are more specifically addressed in <b>Section 7.2 Business Gifts and Entertainment</b> of  <a href="http://sherlink2.sherwin.com/stores/policy/25.0/html_files/25-02.htm">25-02 Code of Conduct</a>. </li>
            <li><b>Competing</b> with Sherwin-Williams or Sherwin-Williams' vendors and/or customers.</li>
            <li>Engaging in, authorizing, or causing another to engage in or authorize, any Sherwin-Williams' business transaction with a relative, or any business organization with which the director or employee, or a <b>family member</b> of any director or employee, is associated.</li>
            <li>Personally taking advantage of a business opportunity that belongs to Sherwin-Williams, or <b>deriving personal profit</b>, gain or financial advantage, other than compensation from Sherwin-Williams, from any Sherwin-Williams' business transaction.</li>
            <li>Using Sherwin-Williams' assets, including Sherwin-Williams' name, trademarks, trade names, facilities or relationships, for <b>personal benefit</b> or for outside work.</li>
            <li>Maintaining a <b>direct or indirect supervisory reporting relationship</b> with any family member or others with whom you have a significant relationship.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> If uncertain whether or not a particular situation creates a conflict or potential conflict of interest, seek advice from your supervisor. In addition, prior to proceeding, you must disclose the conflict or potential conflict in writing using the <b>Potential Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form</b>. </p>
