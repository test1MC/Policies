                        <p>A bid bond is an indemnity bond to bid on work. If a contractor fails to enter into a contract awarded to him, the bond is then forfeited. A bid bond is submitted with the bid proposal and takes the place of a cashier's check or a certified check. When requesting a bid bond, the percentage amount of the bond as well as the actual amount of the bid is required. There is no cost to the store for the bid bond.</p>
