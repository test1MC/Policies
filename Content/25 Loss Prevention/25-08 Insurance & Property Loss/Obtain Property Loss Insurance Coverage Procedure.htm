                        <p>Note: Every practical effort should be utilized to identify an accurate inventory loss. When possible, include the actual inventory figures for damaged or salable inventory as documentation for an insurance claim. When inventory damages are extensive, and sometimes unidentifiable, i.e., a store fire or natural disaster, it may not be practical to count all damaged inventory and expense through the store computer system. Special arrangements can be made through <b>Stores Accounting</b> to obtain a value of damaged inventory.</p>
