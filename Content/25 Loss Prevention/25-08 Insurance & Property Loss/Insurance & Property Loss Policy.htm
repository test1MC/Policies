        <h1>Insurance &amp; Property Loss Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Any loss is to be reported to the <b>Division Loss Prevention Director</b> (<b>Automotive Division</b> report to the <b>Director of Facilities and Safety</b>) in one of two ways: <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Complete a <b>Loss, Offense, and Incident Report</b>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../25-01 Loss Prevention/Loss, Offense, &amp; Incident Policy.htm">Loss, Offense, &amp; Incident Policy</MadCap:xref>. </li><li>Call in the information to <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> if this process is approved in your Division.</li></ol></li>
            <li>After <b>Division Loss Prevention</b> enters the loss into the <b>LOI database</b>, <b>Stores Accounting</b> will collect the information from the database and contact the store. If a loss is not in the <b>LOI database</b>, store credit will not be given.</li>
            <li>The claim is the total of:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Replacement cost of <b>Fixed Assets</b></li><li>Actual cash value of <b>Fixed Assets</b> is not replaced</li><li>Average selling price of inventory lost or destroyed less salvage value</li><li>Clean up expenses, including employee wages, outside temporary help, or other companies hired to assist in clean up</li><li>Actual disposal costs</li><li>Other actual costs incurred due to the loss incident that are the responsibility of the store</li></ol></li>
            <li>Any coverage for outside storage areas must be approved in advance.</li>
            <li>Losses of an undetermined cause or date are not covered.</li>
            <li>Claims are subject to review by <b>Risk Management</b>. </li>
            <li>Large claims will require an inspection by our insurance company adjuster.</li>
            <li>Do not dispose of any damaged property (inventory or otherwise) until instructed to by the <b>Risk Management Department</b>.</li>
            <li>Once the credit entry is processed by <b>Risk Management</b>, the loss is considered "settled” and cannot be reopened.</li>
            <li>Any loss not reported within one year of the occurrence date will not be credited. Any loss reported but not actively followed-up on will be closed one year after the date of the incident.</li>
            <li>Personal property should be reported to employee’s homeowner insurance.</li>
            <li>All claims are subject to the deductible of $5,000.</li>
