        <h1>Certificate of Insurance Overview</h1>
        <p>If a good and valid reason exists to not use the <b>Evidence of Insurance</b>, a <b>Certificate of Insurance</b> may be requested using the following form. Due to processing time, allow five business days from the date the request is received by <b>Risk Management</b>, until the requesting party is in receipt of the certificate. This can be done by completing an&#160; “<b>Certificate of Insurance Form for North America</b>”, which can be found in the <b>Forms Repository</b> (keyword: insurance).&#160; </p>
        <p>You may be asked to provide proof of the insurance coverage that <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> has for public liability, automobile liability, and worker's compensation.</p>
