        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>If the store computer system is closed for the day, follow downtime procedures for any transaction processed after closing the system.</li>
            <li>Complete a <b>Manual Point of Sale Transaction (POST)</b> form capturing the entire sale. If the customer pays by cash the employee must prepare a separate bank deposit form for the "after hours" transaction and include it in the nightly deposit bag. </li>
            <li>After processing the transaction the following day the employee must perform an <b>Interim Deposit transaction</b> for the "after hours" transaction deposit amount.</li>
            <li>Any manual form containing the complete customer credit card number cannot be retained in the forms container. Retain these forms in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe until you’re ready to batch the forms. All manual forms must be retained in a locked filing cabinet or locked store safe after batching in a folder titled <b>Processed Manual Forms.</b></li>
            <li>If the delivery is paid by cash or check, the payment should be returned to the store and processed the same day. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>If the payment cannot be returned the same day, it must be returned and processed within two hours of the driver's start time the following business day.</li><li>The start time will be determined by the <b>Attendance </b>and<b> Time start of day</b> for the employee.</li></ol></li>
