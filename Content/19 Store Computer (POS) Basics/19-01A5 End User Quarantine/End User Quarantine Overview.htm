        <h1>End User Quarantine Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>End User Quarantine (EUQ)</b> is a corporate measure to better secure <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> from external threats, viruses, and unwanted email by allowing employees to control receiving emails they need and eliminating unwanted emails. <b>EUQ</b> is a daily web based service that allows users to see and release messages that have been stopped in quarantine and to <b>safelist senders</b> so that they are not quarantined in the future.&#160; </p>
        <p>Stores will receive an email message with a link to the quarantine showing <b>probable spam</b> received in the past <b>24 hours</b>—if no messages received meet this criteria, no email will be received by the store. A high percentage of messages in quarantine will be obvious spam and bulk email. Once&#160;a specific email address has been added to the <b>safelist</b>, emails from this address will be delivered to the Inbox.</p>
        <p>For any questions, contact the <b>SCO Help Desk</b> at <b>216-566-2740</b> or <a href="mailto:scohelpdesk@sherwin.com">scohelpdesk@sherwin.com</a>.</p>
