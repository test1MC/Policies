        <h1>Email Etiquette Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Sherwin-Williams</b>’ <b>The Americas Group</b> email etiquette rules were implemented for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong class="Strong">Professionalism:</strong> Using proper language will convey a professional image.</li>
            <li><strong class="Strong">Efficiency:</strong> Emails that get to the point are much more effective than poorly worded emails.</li>
            <li><strong class="Strong">Protection from Liability:</strong> Awareness of email risks will protect the Company from costly lawsuits.</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>Do not make an email longer than it needs to be. Remember that reading an email is harder than reading printed communications and <b>long emails</b> can be very discouraging to read.</p>

                        <p>An email reply must <b>answer all questions and pre-empt further questions</b>. If all of the customer's questions in the original email are not answered, the customer will have to send a follow-up email which wastes time for store employees and the customer. Moreover, if  able to pre-empt relevant questions, the customer will be grateful for the efficient and thoughtful customer service.</p>

                        <p>Improper spelling, grammar, and punctuation give a <b>bad impression of the Company</b> and allow for <b>miscommunications</b>. Emails with no full stops or commas are difficult to read and can sometimes change the meaning of the text. Always use the <b>spell check</b> option on the email program, if available.</p>

                        <p>Since reading from a screen is more difficult than reading from paper, an email’s structure and layout is very important. Use <b>short paragraphs</b> and <b>blank lines</b> between each paragraph. When making numerous points, separate them with <b>numbers</b>, <b>letters</b>, or <b>bullets</b>.</p>

                        <p>Read an email before sending it to avoid spelling and grammar mistakes contained in emails. Try to <b>read your message through the eyes of the recipient</b>. This will help to send more effective emails and avoid misunderstandings and inappropriate comments.</p>

                        <p>In business emails, <b>try not to use abbreviations or emojis</b> such as BTW (by the way), LOL (laugh out loud), and the smiley face :-). The recipient might not be aware of the abbreviation’s meaning and, generally, these are not appropriate in business emails. If unsure whether the recipient knows what an abbreviation means, it’s best not to use it.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>Sending an email is like sending a postcard. Don't send the email if you would not want it displayed on a bulletin board. Moreover, never make any libelous, sexist, or racially discriminating comments in emails, even if they are meant to be a joke.</p>

                        <p>Try to use a subject that is <b>meaningful to the recipient</b> as well as yourself. For instance, when sending an email to a company requesting information about a product, it is better to mention the actual name of the product. For example, title a subject 'Product [A] Information' rather than 'product information' or the company's name.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>Whenever possible, use the <b>active voice</b> of a verb. For instance, 'We will process your order today,' sounds better than, 'Your order will be processed today.' The former sounds more personal, whereas the latter, especially when used frequently, sounds unnecessarily formal.</p>

                        <p>Try to keep your sentences to a <b>maximum of 15-20 words</b>. Email is meant to be a quick medium and requires a different kind of writing than letters.  If someone receives an email that looks like a dissertation, chances are that they will not even attempt to read it.</p>

                        <p>If you receive an email message warning you of a new unstoppable virus that will immediately delete everything from your computer, this is most probably a hoax. By forwarding hoaxes you use valuable bandwidth, and sometimes virus hoaxes contain viruses themselves. The same goes for chain letters that promise incredible riches or ask for help for a charitable cause. Even if the content seems to be bona fide, the senders are usually not. Since it is impossible to find out whether a chain letter is real or not, the best place for it is the <b>recycle bin</b>. If you encounter these types of messages, notify <b>Store Computer Operations</b> at <b>216-566-2740</b>.</p>
