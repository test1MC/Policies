        <h1>Email Use Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 45pt;" start="1">
            <li>Email communications must be consistent with <b>Company standards</b> of ethical and proper conduct, behavior, and manners.</li>
            <li>All employees must review the <b>Technology Use Policy</b> in <MadCap:xref href="../../06 Human Resources/06-09 Corporate Policies/Corporate Policies Review Policy.htm">Corporate Policies Review Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Only one person at a time at the store location will be able to access email. There is <b>one email address per store</b>. The email address is (sw [your store number] @sherwin.com). All email addresses default to lower-case lettering.</li>
            <li><b>Incoming email</b> will automatically appear in the <b>Inbox</b>. Check the email two times a day, and only check more if  expecting a customer communication.</li>
            <li>Do not open a message if  store employees do not know the sender, or if the subject is gibberish, objectionable, obviously non-business, etc. Delete the message.</li>
            <li>Avoid posting any <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> email address anywhere on the internet, and, when practical, avoid providing an address to vendors with whom the store does not have a current business relationship. Do not leave business cards in public places.</li>
            <li>Avoid providing a <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>’ email address on web forms and submissions on the internet. Watch for any type of check-box that enrolls the email address into a newsletter or that shares the email address with a <b>third-party</b>.</li>
            <li>Some sites require <b>enrollment</b> or request an email address for free products, free services, or contests. These sites commonly share email addresses as a method of generating revenue.</li>
            <li>Unless  familiar with the senders, never reply to an email requesting a response in order to unsubscribe from an email list. Some individuals and companies use this reply as a method of validating addresses. Then, they use this information to subscribe the email address to other mailing lists. If the sender is unfamiliar, delete the email.</li>
            <li>Never forward an email that claims it is capable of tracking the forward, even if it alleges to generate revenue for a certain cause. These emails are commonly referred to as <b>chain mail</b> and merely help individuals gather email addresses to spam.</li>
        </ol>
