                        <p>Adjusting store hours allows the manager to easily record the store’s operational hours for display on the <b>SOURCE Intranet</b>.

The <b>Adjust Store Hours Link</b> will display when managers log in using their employee number and password. Managers should adjust these hours to match the posted hours at the front of the store. </p>
