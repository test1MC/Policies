        <h1>SOURCE Intranet Tabs Overview</h1>
        <p>Each tab provides access to a range of information specific to it. Depending on an employee's position with the Company, they will have access to various links within each tab. This access is dictated by their login information which is why logging out of <b>SOURCE</b> when finished is so vital. The main tabs are fairly static, but the links under them and the sites they point to are often in flux. Also, because of the depth of information located on the intranet, many tabs have sub tabs that will help to narrow the point of inquiry. </p>
