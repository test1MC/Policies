        <h1>Operating Fund &amp; Target Fund Overview</h1>
        <p>Both <b>operating and target funds</b> are cash-money funds. As cash sales are processed for customers, the amount of cash money in the cash drawer(s) fluctuates throughout the business day. Locations should not permit cash drawers to fall below their <b>target funds</b> nor the location to fall below its <b>operating fund</b>. If a cash drawer or location is falling below the <b>target or operating fund</b> frequently, changes should be discussed with the <b>District Manager</b>.</p>
        <p>All locations operate with two different fund types:</p>
        <table>

                        <p>Sherwin-Williams advances a set amount of cash money to each location. The authorized <b>Operating Fund</b> varies from store to store and is programmed into the computer. The maximum amount allowed, without special permission (written approvals are required and must be kept on file) from the <b>District Manager</b>, is $200.00. The <b>Operating Fund</b> should be disbursed appropriately amongst all the <b>point-of-sale terminals</b> with cash drawers as their <b>target funds</b>.</p>
