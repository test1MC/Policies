        <h1>Book Plan Wallcovering Books Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Book Plan Wallcovering books</b> are sent to you on your weekly <b>STAR order</b> from the <b>DSC</b>. When you accept the receipts on the <b>STAR purchase order</b>, the <b>new wallcovering book</b> is automatically added to your <b>Wallcovering Book Register</b>.</p>
        <p>The <b>Wallcovering Book Register</b> will automatically update each time you properly receive a <b>new wallcovering book</b> against the <b>purchase order</b>. The <b>book register</b> is created after accepting the receipts on the <b>purchase order</b>. Because updating is an automatic process, there is no need to add <b>wallcovering books</b> to the register if they are received properly on the <b>purchase order</b>. The expiration date will automatically update from the <b>SWAT database</b>. However, if there is no expiration date on the <b>SWAT database</b>, you will be required to manually enter it at the store. </p>
        <p>If the store computer system is not able to retrieve the <b>book number</b> from <b>SWAT</b>, a <b>WC BOOKS RECEIVED - NOT REGISTERED report</b> will generate that shows the <b>7-digit sales number</b> and the <b>6-digit book number</b> of the book it cannot locate. Retrieve this report from the <b>Reports File</b> to research the number and then contact <b>SWAT</b> to determine the correct number.</p>
        <p><b>Wallcovering books</b> received directly from the distributor can also be added to the register.</p>
