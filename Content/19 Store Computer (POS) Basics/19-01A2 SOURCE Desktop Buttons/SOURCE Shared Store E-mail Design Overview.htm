        <h1>SOURCE Shared Store E-mail Design Overview</h1>
        <p>Shared store e-mail accounts provide the most reliable method of e-mail communications for <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>' stores, headquarters, field, and customers. Store e-mail communications, much like the store phone or fax, are an open line of communication designed so that e-mail communication is processed quickly and efficiently. Shared accounts ensure that <b>headquarters</b> and <b>field communications</b> will be received in a timely manner and provide customers with the assurance that there will always be an employee available to respond to their communications. A shared store email account also maintains consistent store operations and communications when employee turn-over occurs.</p>
