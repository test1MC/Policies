        <h1>Office Button Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>Libre Office</b> suite is available for additional basic word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation needs not met by other resources and applications (such as <b>Store Reports</b>, <b>Forms Repository</b>, <b>HEARS</b>, etc.). <b>Libre Office</b> functions very similarly to <b>Microsoft Office</b>. </p>
        <p>In addition to creating new documents, <b>LibreOffice</b> allows employees to open and to edit preexisting templates for presentations, spreadsheets, and forms, many of which are available in the <b>Forms Repository</b>.</p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> When selecting <b>LibreOffice</b>,  there will be a prompt to enter a password for <b>Manager Access</b>. All documents created while in <b>Manager Access</b> are confidential which means they cannot be shared. Use this mode for documents to keep private, such as <b>Employee Performance Appraisals</b>. To create <b>Sharable Documents</b>, select <b>No</b> for <b>Manager Access</b>.</p>
