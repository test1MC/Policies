        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 45pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Avoid making after-dark deposits.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Minimize the time spent at the facility. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">At a drive-up facility, keep all the car doors locked and roll windows down only when making the deposit.</li>
