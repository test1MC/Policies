        <h1>Bank Deposit Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Bank deposits must be made at the end of each business day, including <b>weekends</b>, <b>holidays</b>, and during <b>downtime</b>.&#160; Exceptions to this policy may be made for locations in high-risk crime areas and must be approved by both the District Manager and Division Loss Prevention.</li>
            <li>Bank deposits must be made at the store’s assigned bank location or risk citation for a late deposit, missing deposit, etc.</li>
            <li>Bank deposits must be made by a member of store management or a third key holder.</li>
            <li>The deposit must be in a sealed two-pocket <b>deposit bag</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li>After the last terminal is closed, a single bank deposit slip must be filled out including store information, date, and amount of deposit for all of the terminals. Any exception to this procedure must be approved in writing by the Division Controller or Division Director of Loss Prevention.</li>
            <li>The <b>bank deposit slip</b> must be duplicated because some banks will return one <b>validated bank deposit slip</b>, which must be retained in the store.<ol style="margin-left: 36pt;list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li>The store copy of the <b>Check Deposit Log</b> shows the total cash and check deposit information; therefore, it is not necessary to retain an unvalidated copy of the bank deposit slip, as well. </li></ol></li>
            <li>Upon receiving the <b>validated bank deposit slip</b>, a member of store management must verify that the <b>deposit amount</b> agrees with the close transaction total amount and staple the <b>validated bank deposit slip</b> to the appropriately dated <b>close transaction slip</b>. <ol style="margin-left: 36pt;list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li>The same person who made the original deposit cannot perform this verification process.</li></ol></li>
            <li>A <b>Loss, Offense, &amp; Incident Report</b> must immediately be prepared and submitted to <b>Loss Prevention</b> for discrepancies over/short (+/-) $75.00 that cannot be reconciled. Please see <MadCap:xref href="../19-02D POS Close &amp; End of Day/Close Transaction from Main POS Procedure.htm">Close Transaction from Main POS Procedure</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
