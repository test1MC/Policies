        <h1>Store Hours Overview</h1>
        <p>If the <b>normal store hours</b> are changed, they must be changed to reflect the <b>new store hours</b>. For example,  adjust the store hours if the store hours change between winter and summer or the <b>District Manager</b> states that will be open on Sunday.</p>
        <p>It is critical to maintain accurate store hours in both <b>SOURCE</b> and the <b>POS</b> because: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The hours maintained on <b>SOURCE</b> feed the <b>brand website store locator</b> used by customers to locate the store</li>
            <li> The hours in the <b>POS</b> are used for the reporting and receipt functions in <b>POS</b> - the hours in the <b>Open/Close Schedule</b> will be printed on store receipts. </li>
        </ul>
