        <h1>Plan-O-Grams Overview</h1>
        <h2>Applies to The Americas Group Locations only</h2>
        <p><b>Plan-O-Grams</b> are developed by <b>The Americas Group Category Development Dept</b> in <b>Cleveland</b> using state-of-the-art merchandising software.&#160; This software allows for the placement of new and established products in a practical and scientific method assuring maximization of the space and <b>related product sales</b> of every item.&#160; A <b>planogram</b> defines location and quantity of products placed on shelves, which consists of categorizing merchandise, highlighting new and featured products, highlighting impulse items, and creating cross merchandising opportunities. A well <b>Plan-o-Grammed</b> store stays cleaner and better organized, helping customers&#160; find what they need and makes inventorycontrol and product reorder much easier.<b>Plan-O-Grams</b> also take into consideration evolving trends in the <b>paint and coatings industry</b> and allows for the introduction of <b>new products</b> that serve the industry. </p>
        <p><b>New products</b> are often <b>sell tested</b> in our stores prior to being added to our <b>Plan-O-Grams</b>.&#160; This gives <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> an opportunity to better understand the customers' need for these products as well as assisting in <b>pricing strategies</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Plan-O-Gram resets</b> are necessary to align our categories with changes in the marketplace and are required actions for all stores. <b>Plan-O-Grams</b> are updated monthly.&#160; The updates will consist of either a <b>Complete Update</b> requiring major changes to product and/or fixtures, or simply a revision that will consist of minor changes to <b>product locations</b>.</p>
