        <h1>DIY Advertising Overview</h1>
        <p>Sherwin has an aggressive national promotional schedule with sale and preferred customer events throughout the year. These events are supported through national advertising, therefore, it is unnecessary to purchase additional local sale advertising. For exceptions, contact your <b>District Manager</b> with rationale, budget, timing, sales goals and staffing plans to support your requests.</p>
        <p>From time to time, you may have the opportunity to participate in non-sale local advertising to create store awareness and support your community. The process is simple – submit your request to your <b>District Manager</b>, who will work with the <b>Division office</b> to process the request. All local advertising are direct store expenses. Examples of approved local ads include: community brand ad, high school sports program sponsorship, district map/flyer, etc.</p>
