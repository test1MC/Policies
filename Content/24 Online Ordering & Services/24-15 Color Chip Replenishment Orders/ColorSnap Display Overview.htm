        <h1>ColorSnap Display Overview</h1>
        <p>A well-stocked <b>ColorSnap Display</b> is a powerful selling tool.&#160;The display should be reviewed for stocking needs at least once a week and, if required, a <b>replenishment order</b> for <b>color chips, cards, and books</b> placed with <b>ChromaSource</b>.</p>
        <p>To ensure a full-stocked display, it is recommended that you stock from the bottom up;&#160; utilize the storage in the bottom of the <b>ColorSnap Display</b> to stock additional packets of <b>color chips</b>.&#160; As <b>color chips</b> require replenishment, restock from the bottom and be sure to re-order to stock both your top and bottom.&#160;You may want to consider stocking several packets of the most popular colors.</p>
        <p>You should be aware of the following order restrictions when placing orders via <b>ChromaSource</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may order only 5 packets of each color per order.</li>
            <li>You must order at least 10 items per order.</li>
            <li>You may order only 200 lines (colors) per order.</li>
            <li>You are permitted to place three orders per calendar week.</li>
