                            <li>Search for stores that may be moving the product by selecting on the <b>Sales #</b> (Stores highlighted in green have two months or less supply)</li>
                            <li>Contact customers who have previously purchased the products.</li>
                            <li>Use the <b>Authorized Return Process</b> (located in the <b>Forms Repository</b>).</li>
