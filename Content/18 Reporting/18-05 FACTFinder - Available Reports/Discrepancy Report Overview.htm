        <h1>Discrepancy Report Overview</h1>
        <p>The <b>Discrepancy Report</b> is being replaced by the <b>Notes/Questions feature</b> in <b>FACTFinder</b> where stores can send a question or comment to the appropriate group in order to correct <b>expense errors</b> on the <b>Stores Purchases Report</b>.

            <li>An <b>expense invoice</b> is charged to the wrong <b>Prime-Sub Account</b>.</li>
