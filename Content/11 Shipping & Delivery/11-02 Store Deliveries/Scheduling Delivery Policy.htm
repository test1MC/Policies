        <h1>Scheduling Delivery Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Schedule a delivery as soon as you know when your customer wants the order delivered—do not wait.&#160;&#160; </li>
            <li>Delivery schedule function should be used to schedule customer orders for delivery, <b>IST transactions</b>, repair (spray) orders, customer returns to be picked up on-site, <b>DSC</b> will call purchase orders, and vendor pick-up.&#160;&#160; </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Miscellaneous stops may be scheduled to handle a situation not defined by the system such as a situation where a sales number does not exist or for transporting unopened product which will be returned to your store to a tinting facility for tinting. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Spray repair facilities wishing to return a repaired unit to an originating store location MUST schedule this using the <b>Miscellaneous Stop</b>.</li>
            <li>In an <b>ISR/IST situation</b>, the store transferring the goods MUST schedule the delivery and create the <b>Bill-of-Lading</b>. The requesting store will assume the cost of the delivery. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>The <b>Stock Transfer option</b> in <b>Customer Order Entry</b> MUST be used for all <b>ISR situations</b> between two stores utilizing the <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b>.</li>
                <li>The <b>ISR Purchase Order</b> should not be used to schedule a delivery.</li>
                <li>A <b>Misc Stop</b> should not be used to schedule the delivery. If used, the delivery will not be dispatched.</li>
                <li>In situations where one store is on the <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b> and the second store is not, a <b>Misc Stop</b> may be used if there is prior <b>District Manager</b> and/or <b>City Manager</b> approval via email, or if the <b>dispatch</b> team is called.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>You must submit your order for delivery by the cut-off time indicated for each delivery type window. When selecting a delivery time, always err on the side of customer service and select the earlier time if your customer’s requested time is close.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>The <b>Anytime delivery option</b> has been replaced with the <b>Planned (AM and PM) options</b> in order to specify delivery needs and improve clarity on the order’s urgency. The new system functions in increments of three hour delivery windows. When entered a day in advance, the latter 3 options will be charged <b>Flat Rate</b>; when entered same day, they will carry the <b>Premium Rate</b>. </li>
                <li><b>AM Critical</b> remains a <b>Planned delivery option</b> and carries the <b>Premium Rate</b> whereas <b>ISTs</b> and <b>Miscellaneous delivery orders</b> will carry the <b>Flat Rate</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Urgent Deliveries</b> are a same-day delivery option only when charged at the <b>Priority Rate</b>, which is a price increase from the former cost structure. </li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>District Managers</b> and/or <b>City Managers</b> are authorized to call the dispatcher to accommodate emergency delivery orders outside the established delivery times.&#160;&#160;If you need to request an emergency delivery, be sure to let your customer know that this is an exception. They must understand our ability to accommodate the emergency is predicated by limited truck and driver availability.&#160; </li>
            <li>Drivers are not permitted to pick-up orders that have not been scheduled for delivery.&#160;Do not ask drivers to take unscheduled orders that are not displayed as part of their route on their <b>driver Device</b>. If you have an emergency, call your <b>District or City Manager</b>.</li>
