        <h1>Create Delivery &amp; Pickup Schedule Procedure</h1>
        <h2>This section does NOT apply to TAG Stores participating in the Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service.</h2>
        <p>The daily <b>Delivery and Pickup Schedule</b> allows users to schedule <b>customer orders</b> for delivery and <b>ISTs</b> for a delivery route. Users are also able to schedule miscellaneous stops to accommodate situations that may arise, such as a customer return from a job site. The <b>Delivery &amp; Pickup Schedule</b> can be created and managed on <b>POS</b>. If the system is unavailable, the manual <b>Delivery &amp; Pickup Schedule</b> (located in the <b>Forms Repository</b>) may be used. Open <b>Delivery Schedules</b> created in the system display in the <b>Status Reminder Box</b>.</p>
