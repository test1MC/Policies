        <h1>Estimated Time of Arrival Policy</h1>
        <p>You are able to check the status of a delivery directly from the system. Note the following policy on estimated time of arrival:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>The <b>Delivery Status</b> feature provides an estimated time only. Delivery is only guaranteed to arrive within the time dictated by the order cut-off selected unless you have been notified otherwise by <b>Central Dispatch</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To check the status of a delivery:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From <b>POS desktop</b>, select <b>Store</b> -&gt;  <b>Customer Order Entry</b> -&gt; <b>Submit Order for Delivery</b> -&gt; <b>Check Status of Delivery Orders</b></li>
