        <h1>Store Deliveries Overview</h1>
        <p>As a convenience to our customers, Sherwin-Williams may often deliver or ship merchandise to a specific location requested by the customer. Several options exist for stores to deliver product to customers. Some stores may have their own delivery vehicle due to the volume of orders delivered or geographical consideration. Most stores handle their deliveries using their district managed <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b>, which makes the delivery process more efficient. New users of <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Services</b> should review <a href="http://prodweb.sherwin.com/stores/allp/sourcehome/applications/swds/training.pdf">Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service Training</a> and <a href="http://cpapp1.sherwin.com:81/operations/delivery_service/deliveryservice_roles.htm">Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service Roles</a> to understand their role in ensuring successful <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b> operations.</p>
        <p>On occasion, the delivery of product to customers may require approved use of a third party, such as a common carrier, air delivery service, or cargo service. For more information on third party deliveries, please refer to <MadCap:xref href="../11-01 Packaging &amp; 3rd Party Shipping/Packaging &amp; 3rd Party Shipping Overview.htm">Packaging &amp; 3rd Party Shipping Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the method of shipment, Sherwin-Williams’ employees are responsible for adhering to all regulations and laws regarding the packaging and shipment of hazardous product.
