        <h1>Delivery Inspection Report Policy</h1>
        <p>A required procedure at each branch is the verification of outbound deliveries on branch delivery vehicles. Regular inspections and verification of outbound deliveries will help identify unintentional errors and will act as a deterrent to merchandise theft.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Delivery inspections must be conducted and recorded at least three (3) times per week at each branch using the <b>Delivery Inspection Report</b>. The inspection should determine that the proper physical count of items agrees with the items on the sales invoice or system generated delivery document.&#160;It is important that you have written documentation of these required delivery inspections.</li>
            <li>The vehicle cab and interior are to be visually checked to determine that no unauthorized merchandise is being removed from the facility.</li>
            <li>Variances and discrepancies in deliveries must be recorded on the <b>Delivery Inspection Report Form</b>, investigated immediately, and reconciled. Contact <b>Loss Prevention</b> when appropriate.</li>
            <li>Upon completion of the delivery inspection, the delivery vehicle is to immediately depart the facility.</li>
            <li>Although branch management should conduct delivery inspections, management can delegate this responsibility to a qualified employee (i.e. – <b>ABM</b>). The employee responsible for loading the delivery cannot have the responsibility for the delivery inspection procedure. Drivers may not verify each other’s deliveries. The <b>Branch Manager</b> must conduct periodic inspections even if the responsibility has been delegated to a qualified employee.</li>
            <li>Completed delivery inspection reports must to be kept on file at each branch for a minimum of one year, available for inspection and review.</li>
        </ol>
