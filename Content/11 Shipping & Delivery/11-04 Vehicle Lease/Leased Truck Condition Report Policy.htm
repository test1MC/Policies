                <li>The current odometer reading on the current truck must be disclosed and verified to ensure that the minimum mileage for turn-in has been obtained. The application for a new truck will be returned if the <b>Leased Truck Condition Report</b> does not contain an accurate odometer reading for the truck being returned.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The <b>Vehicle Condition Report</b> is contained in the <b>Leased Truck Application Packet</b>, which can be obtained from any <b>District Office, Division Office, or Fleet Operations</b>. </li>
