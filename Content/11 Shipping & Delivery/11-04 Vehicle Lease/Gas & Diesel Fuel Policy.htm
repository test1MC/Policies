        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>All Sherwin-Williams' leased vehicles must use the type of fuel specified in the owner’s manual supplied by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>If there is any question as to the type of fuel to be used, contact <b>Fleet Operations</b>.</li>
            <li>Self-service fuel pumps are to be used at all times. The use of full service fuel pumps is prohibited unless the driver is physically unable to use self-service pumps.</li>
            <li>Each <b>store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b> that has a <b>store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service vehicle</b> will receive a <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express gas card</b> as part of the <b>Lease Plan Driver’s Packet</b>.&#160;The <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express Gas Card</b> is the only approved method to pay for gas purchases for the company vehicle. Unless the <b>Wright Express card</b> is lost, stolen, or isn't working, gas purchases for the vehicle are not to be reimbursed by a <b>Cash Disbursement transaction</b> or processed on a <b>Travel and Expense Report</b>. </li>
            <li>A <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express Gas Card</b> should only be used to purchase fuel for the vehicle number that is shown on the last line of the gas card.&#160; Failure to restrict the gas card usage to only the vehicle number shown on the card will result in discrepancies on the gas card tracking system.</li>
            <li>Do not transfer the <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express Gas Card</b> to another vehicle or to another driver.&#160; If the vehicle shown on the bottom line of the gas card is turned in or transferred, destroy the gas card.</li>
            <li>Only gas should be purchased using the <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express gas card</b>.&#160;No other merchandise or materials such as food, sodas, repairs, oil etc., should be purchased with the <b>Lease Plan/Wright Express gas card</b>.&#160;A car wash purchased at the pump is allowed.</li>
