        <h1>DOT Safety Inspection Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive Branches</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>All vehicles must undergo annual safety inspections through programs that are approved by the <b>United States Department of Transportation (DOT)</b>. New vehicles that are received during the year should have a <b>DOT inspection</b> performed upon delivery.&#160;In January of each year, <b>Fleet Operations</b> will mail a <b>DOT/Safety Inspection Form</b> to each <b>store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal</b> that has a truck.&#160;Additional inspection forms may be obtained from <b>Fleet Operations</b> upon request.</li>
            <li>The <b>Store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal Manager</b> or <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service Lead Driver</b> must ensure that the <b>DOT/Safety</b> inspection is performed and all related repairs made by April 15. The inspection must be done on all trucks regardless of the size or age.</li>
            <li>Proof of inspection must be kept with each vehicle. This proof may be an approved decal or a copy of the inspection record.</li>
            <li>Failure to produce proof of inspection may subject the vehicle to a $500 a day fine.</li>
            <li>If a truck resides in a state where the state inspection does not suffice, then contact an approved inspection facility and have the safety inspection performed.</li>
            <li>Once the inspection has been completed, the distribution of the form is as follows:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li><b>Original - Inspecting Vendor/Garage</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Duplicate - Store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal File</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Vehicle Copy - Kept in Truck</b>
                </li>
