        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li> <b>Sherwin-Williams Leased Vehicle</b> should not be operated in such a condition as to likely cause an accident or a breakdown of the vehicle.</li>
            <li>Any vehicle discovered to be in an unsafe condition while being operated on the highway may be continued in operation only to the nearest place where repairs can safely be affected.</li>
            <li>Such operation should be conducted only if it is less hazardous to the public than to permit the vehicle to remain on the highway. </li>
            <li>All employees driving a <b>Sherwin-Williams leased vehicle</b> should comply with the <b>Federal DOT rules</b> and company policies.</li>
            <li>Every vehicle should be driven and parked in compliance with the laws, ordinances, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is being operated unless they are at variance with specific regulations of the <b>Department of Transportation</b>, which are applicable to the operation of that vehicle and which impose a more stringent obligation or restraint.</li>
            <li>All traffic violation fines or costs will be the personal expense of the driver.</li>
            <li>Parking violations, which are not properly handled by the driver, are generally forwarded to the lease company, who will then forward to <b>Fleet Operations</b>. <b>Fleet Operations</b> will forward any parking violations to the <b>Loss Prevention Director</b> in each division.</li>
            <li>A driver who receives a notice that his/her license, permit, or privilege to operate a vehicle has been revoked, suspended, or withdrawn must notify their supervisor and <b>Fleet Operations</b> of the contents of the notice by the end of the next business day or the start of his/her next shift, whichever comes first.</li>
