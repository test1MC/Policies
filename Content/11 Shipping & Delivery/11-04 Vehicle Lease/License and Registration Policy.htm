            <li>All leased vehicles are enrolled in an automatic licensing program with the <b>leasing company</b>. The <b>leasing company</b> will handle the licensing and registration requirements with each state and mail the new plates and/or new registration to the driver’s home address prior to the expiration of the old plates and/or registration.</li>
            <li>If there are additional requirements that are necessary for registration, such as a state inspection, the <b>leasing company</b> will notify the driver at his/her home address of the requirements. The driver will be instructed to supply the <b>leasing company</b> with any additional information that is needed to register the vehicle.</li>
            <li>If there is a need for the <b>leasing company</b> to send the driver the title for the vehicle in order to meet a requirement for registration, the title must be sent back to the <b>leasing company</b> when the registration process is completed.</li>
