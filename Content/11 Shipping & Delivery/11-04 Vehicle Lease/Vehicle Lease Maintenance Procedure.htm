        <h1>Vehicle Lease Maintenance Procedure</h1>
        <p>The <b>LeasePlan Maintenance Guide</b> shows maintenance items and the recommended mileage as to when the maintenance should be done. The coupons are good at any of the national account facilities that are part of the <b>LeasePlan Program</b>. Please review these recommended services and coupons, which are provided as a convenient reminder and means of payment for maintenance that should be done. At the bare minimum, ensure the following maintenance is done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil changes at a minimum of 5,000 mile intervals (this is based on estimated hours of operation in “normal” conditions)</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li>&#160;Several factors  determine if more frequent oil changes are required:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extreme weather fluctuations</li>
                    <li>Driving in heavy traffic with the significant time spent idling</li>
                    <li>Vehicle <b>Owner’s Manual</b> maintenance schedule</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Tire replacement when tread depth is recorded at or below 1/16 of an inch</li>
            <li>Have brakes checked at least every 15,000 miles or when the brakes are making noise</li>
        </ul>

                        <p>Tell the advisor what repairs or maintenance you feel need to be done.</p>
                        <p>Note:&#160; In order for the <b>LeasePlan Program</b> to work properly, it is extremely important that the <b>Store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal Manager</b> or <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service Lead Driver</b> (not the servicing facility) contacts <b>LeasePlan</b> initially. This ensures needless repairs are not done to your truck.  <b>LeasePlan</b> will then issue a purchase order to the servicing facility to cover the cost of the repairs.</p>

                        <p>Pick up the truck after the work is completed. Do not pay the servicing facility at that time.</p>
                        <p>Note: The servicing facility will bill <b>LeasePlan</b> who will bill your store or <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service cost center</b> through <b>Accounts Payable</b>.</p>
