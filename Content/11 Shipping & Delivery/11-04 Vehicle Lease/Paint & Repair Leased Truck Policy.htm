        <h1>Paint &amp; Repair Leased Truck Policy</h1>
        <p>Sherwin-Williams has chosen to partner with <b>LeasePlan</b> to help maximize the savings on vehicle maintenance. It is important to understand the reasons for performing scheduled maintenance and your responsibility, as a corporate fleet driver, to ensure this maintenance happens. Review <b>Understanding Sherwin-Williams’ Maintenance Program</b> to learn more about the <b>fleet maintenance program</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Vehicles must be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The owner's manual provided with the truck outlines frequency and type of maintenance that must be performed. </li>
            <li>A <b>Lease Plan Vehicle Maintenance Guide</b> is contained in the <b>LeasePlan Driver’s Packet</b> that is mailed to all Sherwin-Williams locations with store vehicles.&#160;This <b>Vehicle Maintenance Guide</b> outlines the required maintenance and the mileage intervals when the required maintenance should be performed. It also lists the various national account that can perform not only required maintenance, but also any other needed repairs.</li>
            <li>The employee is responsible for keeping the leased vehicle in safe condition, good working order and appearance.&#160; Any loss incurred when the vehicle is turned in that is due to non-conformance or negligence as it pertains to the Sherwin-Williams’ maintenance and repair policy may be charged back to the store/district.</li>
            <li>Stores must visit the approved repair facility and get approval from <b>LeasePlan</b> prior to starting maintenance.&#160;Every maintenance item must be billed through <b>LeasePlan</b>.</li>
            <li>Use only the approved repair facilities listed below.&#160; The list is smaller than what you got in your packet since some of the accounts used by <b>LeasePlan</b> are high in price and value.&#160;Approved repair facilities are:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li><b>Goodyear</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Firestone</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Michelin</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Sears</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Pep Boys</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Merchant Tire</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>Tire Kingdom</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>NTB</b>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Change the oil in your vehicle every 5,000 miles, which is recommended by Ford, not every 3,000.&#160;The sticker that is put on by the oil change facility is there to drive more business into their shop.</li>
            <li>Every maintenance item over $500 will be called into <b>Sherwin Williams Fleet Operations</b> for approval.</li>
            <li><b>LeasePlan</b> will be instructed to specify safe tires, batteries, etc. for our vehicles.&#160; Do not ask for high mileage tires, special batteries, premium oil, or other items that are marketed as “better.”&#160; </li>
            <li><b>LeasePlan</b> will also act as an intermediary with automobile dealers for warranty recovery or repairs done under warranty.</li>
            <li>Stores should be aware of the following regarding <b>LeasePlan</b> service providers:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>If there is a question whether to take the <b>store/Sherwin Williams Delivery Service truck</b> to a national account store verses a dealership, contact <b>LeasePlan</b> prior to going to the repair facility. This is especially the case if the needed service is something other than scheduled maintenance.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Occasionally, some repairs will be authorized by <b>LeasePlan</b> or <b>Sherwin-Williams Fleet Operations</b> without the <b>Store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal Manager's or Lead Driver’s approval</b>. These repairs will be for maintenance items to maintain the resale value of the truck or repairs that are safety related such as brakes and tires.</li>
            <li>The <b>LeasePlan advisor</b> has an authorization limit for repairs up to $1,000.00.</li>
            <li>Each <b>LeasePlan advisor</b> is a certified mechanic. They will authorize requested repairs based on reasonable pricing, length of time needed to perform the repair, and the mileage or age of the vehicle.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>The <b>LeasePlan advisor</b> will also ensure that any repair that should be covered by <b>Manufacturer's warranty</b> is submitted for consideration. If the needed repairs exceed $1,000.00, the <b>LeasePlan advisor</b> will contact <b>Fleet Operations</b> to review the needed repairs/maintenance. </li>
                <li>If there is a question about whether the repair should be performed because of mileage or the age of the vehicle, <b>Fleet Operations</b> will be contacted to discuss the repairs.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>All pricing under the <b>LeasePlan Program</b> is <b>National Account pricing</b>, which is a negotiated, consistent price for all <b>Sherwin-Williams' leased vehicles</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li>When picking up the vehicle after the work is completed, do not pay the repair facility.&#160;The repair facility will bill <b>LeasePlan</b>, who in turn, will bill Sherwin-Williams.&#160;The repair amount will be billed to either the store or <b>Sherwin-Williams Delivery Terminal cost center</b> through <b>Accounts Payable</b>.</li>
            <li>Do not list any repairs or maintenance covered by lease plan or the lease plan coupon book on monthly expense reports or pay by processing a <b>Miscellaneous Disbursement Transactions</b>.&#160; </li>
