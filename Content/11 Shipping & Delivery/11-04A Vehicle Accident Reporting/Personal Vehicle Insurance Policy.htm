        <h1>Personal Vehicle Insurance Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Every employee who drives their personal vehicle on company business must carry insurance on the vehicle at their own expense. The liability limits are at least $100,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $50,000 per occurrence for property damage.</li>
            <li>This is a minimum insurance requirement and should not be interpreted as meaning that these limits are necessarily sufficient for every individual. It is strongly recommended to most individuals that for their own adequate protection they should carry higher limits.</li>
            <li>Due to geographical practice or extreme hardship, lower levels of coverage may be allowed. Requests for exceptions on an individual basis must be submitted to <b>Corporate Risk Management</b> for approval.</li>
            <li>Employees using personal vehicles to make <b>store/Sherwin-Williams Delivery Service</b> deliveries are not covered by Sherwin-Williams auto insurance.</li>
            <li>Damage to the employee’s personal vehicle is not the responsibility of the Sherwin-Williams Company and the expense for such insurance and/or damage is included in the business mileage allowance paid for business use while using a personal vehicle.</li>
        </ol>
