            <li>The customer is willing to pay cash up front for a very high-valued product when normally there are payment terms and other methods of payment.</li>
            <li>The customer is unfamiliar with the product’s performance characteristics but still wants the product.</li>
            <li>The customer declines routine installation, training, or maintenance services.</li>

            <li>The shipping route is abnormal for the product and destination.</li>
            <li>When questioned, the buyer is evasive or unclear about whether purchase of the product will be used for domestic uses, export, or reexport. </li>
