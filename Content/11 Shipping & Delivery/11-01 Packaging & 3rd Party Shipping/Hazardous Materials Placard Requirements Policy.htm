        <h1>Hazardous Materials Placard Requirements Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>All vehicles transporting 1,001 pounds or more of products that are classified as hazardous material must be placarded. The placards must clearly communicate the hazard and be visible on all sides of the vehicle (this includes all trucks and vans transporting 1,001 pounds or more of hazardous materials).</li>
            <li>All stores offering 1,001 pounds or more of hazardous materials in commerce must offer the transporting carrier the appropriate hazard placards prior to or at the time the material is offered for transportation unless the carrier's vehicle is already placarded for the materials.</li>
            <li>The vehicle driver must acknowledge that placards were offered. The transport vehicle driver must sign the [placard offered] <b>checkmark statement</b> located on the <b>bill-of-lading</b> when product is offered for transport by a third party common carrier.</li>
            <li><b>Consumer Commodity ORM-D products</b> being offered for transportation are not required to be provided with placards.</li>
            <li>A vehicle transporting less than 1,001 pounds of hazardous materials does not require the use of placards. When transporting less than 1,001 pounds of hazardous materials, placard brackets permanently installed on vehicles should display the blank placard. </li>
            <li><b>Delivery Drivers</b> transporting 1,001 pounds of hazardous material must be 21 years-of-age, maintain a valid and current commercial driver's license (<b>CDL</b>), have a hazardous materials endorsement, and must have a current <b>DOT</b> medical exam certification.</li>
            <li>The 1,001 pound hazardous material threshold in this section refers only to hazardous materials found on <b>Table 2 of 49 CFR 172.504</b>.</li>
