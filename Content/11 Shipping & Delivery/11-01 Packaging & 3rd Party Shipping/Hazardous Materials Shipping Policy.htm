        <h1>Hazardous Materials Shipping Policy</h1>
        <p>According to the <b>U.S. Department of Transportation</b> (<b>DOT</b>), hazardous materials are substances or materials capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property when transported in commerce. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>With few exceptions, the <b>DOT regulations</b> comply with international standards.&#160; <b>DOT</b>, or a state’s implementing agency, regulates the transportation of hazardous materials. </li>
            <li>The <b>DOT</b> specifies the classification of materials, labeling, packaging, marking, placarding, documentation, vehicles, and other general requirements for transportation. </li>
            <li>Shipments of hazardous materials not in compliance with federal or state transportation requirements may be subject to fines as high as $25,000 per violation. </li>
            <li>In addition, the person who transported or who prepared the shipment for transport may face personal fines or imprisonment upon conviction of "willful" violations. </li>
            <li>As a shipper or offerer of hazardous materials for transportation, the <b>Store Manager</b> must ensure that the shipment complies with <b>DOT regulations</b>.</li>
            <li>A store must not offer or accept hazardous materials for transportation in commerce unless that material is properly classed, described, packaged, marked, labeled, in proper condition for shipment, and accompanied by shipping papers.</li>
            <li>Hazardous materials are to be transported only over public highway. Do NOT transport or ship hazardous materials by aircraft, rail or water vessels, unless authorized by <b>Stores Safety &amp; Environmental</b> at 216-566-1710.</li>
            <li><b>The information in this section does not apply to shipments by air or cargo.</b>&#160;Stores that do not have an employee trained and certified by <b>Stores Safety &amp; Environmental</b> many not prepare for shipment or arrange for transport any hazardous materials or any other paint or paint-related products.</li>
