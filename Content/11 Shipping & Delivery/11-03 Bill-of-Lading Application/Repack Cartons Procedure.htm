        <h1>Repack Cartons Procedure</h1>
        <p>Once all the issues are resolved with items for which a <strong class="Strong">BOL Code</strong> could not be automatically assigned, you may need to create <strong class="Strong">Repack Cartons</strong>.&#160; Look to the far right column entitled <strong class="Strong">Remaining Loose Units</strong>.&#160; If you have any loose units in your shipment, you must specify repack carton information. If you are creating a <strong class="Strong">Bill-of-Lading</strong> for a<strong class="Strong"> Customer Delivery</strong>, use the pick ticket as a guide to creating <strong class="Strong">Repack Cartons</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Note: In future releases, restrictions will be imposed on the user regarding which items may be packaged together based on regulatory requirements.&#160; For now, repack cartons should be created by users familiar with packaging regulations. The <strong class="Strong">Repack Carton Window</strong> displays information for those items that have been identified by the user as packaged in the repack carton being created or edited.</p>
