        <h1>Frozen Material Overview</h1>
        <p>Sherwin-Williams takes precautions to keep products from freezing, including the installation of heaters in <b>CTS trailers</b> that operate in colder climates. Despite these preventative measures, frozen paint can still reach the store. </p>
        <p>To identify frozen paint:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SHAKE the first few pails of freezable product by hand to see if paint has solidified.</li>
            <li>FEEL the side of the pails to gauge temperature.</li>
            <li>LOOK to see if any of the pails are bulging.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any products do not feel or look right, open the paint and make a visual inspection. Pay particular attention to any product with a <b>Green Sure designation</b>. Typically, these products do not have any freeze-thaw stability and will be unusable once frozen. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Call (216-566-2297 [option #5]) <b>Billing</b> within a day of noticing the frozen paint. It is mandatory that all of these situations are recorded. You will need to provide the following information in your correspondence:<br /></li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><b>PO Number</b>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>Sales Numbers of Frozen Material</b>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>Quantity of Frozen Material</b>
                    <br />
                </li>
                <li><b>MMS Receiving Status of the Frozen Product</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not file a freight claim directly with the carrier. Credit will be passed to the store via the <b>IBAR</b> process. All claims will be filed with the carrier by <b>Global Supply Chain</b>. This will ensure we have visibility of all shipments affected by freezing. </p>
        <p>There are certain times when carriers issue embargoes on shipping. If <b>Global Supply Chain</b> has chosen to ship during an embargo it will not affect credits due to the store for frozen shipments. The credits will still be passed to the store via the <b>IBAR</b> process.</p>
