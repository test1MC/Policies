        <h1>Tax Levy Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Usually, the first warning of a <b>Tax Levy</b> is a telephone call from <b>Stores Group Bookkeeping</b> asking whether or not an employee owes a particular installer any money currently or will in the near future.&#160; From that time on, the store cannot make any payments to that installer without permission from the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b> or a written release from the <b>taxing authority</b>.&#160; Failure to comply could result in the store being charged for the payment illegally made to the installer plus a <b>fifty percent penalty</b>.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
