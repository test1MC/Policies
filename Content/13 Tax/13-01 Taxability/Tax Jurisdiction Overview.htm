        <h1>Tax Jurisdiction Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SOURCE</b> uses third-party software, <b>Taxware</b>, to properly collect and report sales tax information.&#160;<b>Taxware</b> validates a customer’s correct taxing jurisdiction and returns a tax rate using <b>VeraZip</b>, which depends on the <b>zip code</b> of the shipping location or store location to determine the correct <b>tax rate</b> for a sale.&#160; If the <b>zip code</b> exists in more than one city or county, the user may need to provide further information such as the county in which the customer is located or whether or not the customer is within city limits to ensure the correct rate is chosen.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Taxware</b> not only handles correct calculation of sales and use tax, it keeps <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>’ <b>tax rates</b> current.&#160; <b>Taxware</b> information is updated monthly to reflect <b>tax holiday information</b>, <b>changing tax rates</b>, and <b>changing tax laws</b>.</li>
            <li>Correct entry of the <b>ShipTo Address</b> for deliveries and installations is critical.&#160; A specific street address for a job is not required - the crucial information is <b>city, state, and zip code</b>.&#160; The taxing jurisdiction will be verified each time a ship to address is entered on the customer order or the point-of-sale transaction by verifying that the city, state, and zip code combination is valid.&#160; If the entered combination is not valid, <b>SOURCE</b> will not let you proceed until the error is corrected.&#160; </li>
        </ul>
