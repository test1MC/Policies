        <h1>Interstate Sales Overview</h1>
        <p>Since <b>The Sherwin-Williams Company</b>, its divisions, and affiliates are registered for sales and use tax and operate in all states that presently impose such a tax, <b>S-W</b> cannot exempt <b>out-of-state sales</b> that are taxable. In addition, many states have entered into reciprocal agreements, which make the collection of another state's tax mandatory.</p>
