        <h1>Transaction Taxability Overview</h1>
        <p><b>SOURCE</b> allows for three basic taxing situations to be processed for transactions: <b>taxable sale</b> (standard rate), <b>tax exception sale</b> (non-standard rate, amount or exemption.)&#160; It is critical to note that a tax exception may not apply to the entire transaction. Some line items may still require the collection of <b>standard tax</b> based on the taxability of the product for the transaction.&#160; </p>
        <p>Transaction taxability is determined by several factors unique to each transaction:</p>

                        <p>Each <b>state/province</b> (and some local entities) sets its own rules regarding tax rates, tax holidays, use tax, tax exemptions, and product taxability for its jurisdiction. The taxing jurisdiction for a transaction is determined by where the transfer of product occurs.&#160; Orders, which are delivered to a customer or have an installation address, will be taxed according to the <b>delivery/installation address</b>. Orders, which are sold to the customer within the store, will be governed by the <b>tax rules for the jurisdiction in which the store is located</b>.&#160; </p>
