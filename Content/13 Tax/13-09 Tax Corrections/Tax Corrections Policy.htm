        <h1>Tax Corrections Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>If a customer claims they are exempt, but they do not have an exemption certificate on file, it is required to collect tax.&#160; The customer may return later with an exemption certificate and request a refund of tax collected.&#160; </li>
            <li>Tax corrections must reference the correctly corresponding <b>Tax Record Card</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li>Stores can only run <b>tax corrections</b> for sales originally processed at their location. </li>
            <li>Tax corrections must use the same rules used in sale transactions.&#160; When using <b>sales numbers</b> in a correction transaction, the system will determine the taxability of each product.&#160; When using the 9999-99998 number, users are required to correctly calculate the <b>taxable amount</b> and should review the taxability of each product based on the <b>customer’s exemption reason</b> before running the correction.</li>
            <li>Tax corrections are not to be used to refund tax to a customer <b>disputing the taxability</b> of product(s) on an invoice.&#160;These questions should be addressed with the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b> for review.</li>
            <li>Tax corrections are not to be used to adjust accounts which have <b>short-payed</b> their invoice due to a dispute over the taxable amount.&#160; These questions should be addressed with the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b> for review.</li>
            <li>Stores incorrectly using the correction transaction to refund tax to a customer will be required to reverse the correction transaction.</li>
            <li>Customers may request refunds of collected tax for a certain period of time (typically, three to four years) which varies by state.&#160;Some certificates and permits are only retroactive for a certain time period and some may never allow for retroactive refund of tax.&#160;Carefully review <b>customer documentation</b> and <b>state information</b> to ensure compliance.&#160; <ol style="margin-left: 36pt;list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li>For example, the following states limit the time period in which sales tax may be refunded: Rhode Island, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.&#160; Refunds may be subjected to other limitations decreed by the state. </li></ol></li>
            <li>Tax corrections must <b>ALWAYS</b> be completed using the correction transaction. <b>NEVER</b> refund tax as a line item on a return transaction.&#160; While the customer’s accounting will balance, this results in lowered sales for the store.&#160; Tax is not “sold” to a customer, but, “collected” for the state or local entity.&#160; <b>Refunding tax is a correction and never a return.</b></li>
            <li>When a customer requests a refund of tax over several invoices, please note that the tax correction transaction should tie back to an original transaction.&#160; This means that a separate correction transaction must be run for each sale transaction run during the time period for which the customer requests a refund.&#160; </li>
            <li>If you have 10 or fewer transactions, please handle each separately.&#160;If you have more than 10 transactions, run a single correction transaction en masse representing all invoices for which a refund is being granted.</li>
            <li>If the original transaction contained items which were taxed and items which were not taxed, the <b>Correction Transaction</b> should only be run for the product(s) requiring correction.&#160;<ol style="margin-left: 36pt;list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li>For example, if tax was charged incorrectly on two items, the <b>Sub-Total</b> should be entered as the <b>extended Sub-Total</b> of those two items.&#160; </li></ol></li>
            <li>Do not mix taxed and non-taxed items on the same <b>Correction Transaction</b>.&#160;If the correction requires both the collection and the refund of tax, it is required to run two separate transactions. </li>
            <li>If tax is not collected for a cash sale and it is later determined that tax should have been collected and the customer cannot be reached, the store must assume the <b>tax liability</b> for that sale.&#160;This may occur if the customer does not present or have on a file a <b>tax exemption certificate</b> at the time of the sale or if a <b>tax exemption certificate</b> on file is found to be <b>invalid</b> after the sale has been run.</li>
            <li><b>Sales number 9999-9999-8</b> is only to be used to correct sales tax. Do not use this number for any other purpose.</li>
