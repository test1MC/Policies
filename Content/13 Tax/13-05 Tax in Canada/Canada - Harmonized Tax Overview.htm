        <h1>Canada - Harmonized Tax Overview</h1>
        <h2>This section is for all locations in Ontario and British Columbia</h2>
        <p>Effective 07/01/10, <b>Ontario</b> and <b>British Columbia</b> harmonized their sales tax so that <b>GST</b> and <b>PST</b> tax is replaced by the <b>HST (harmonized) tax</b>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ontario and British Columbia sales invoices on the <b>POS</b> list the total tax as one percentage.&#160; Ontario's <b>combined tax rate</b> is 13% (5% federal; 8% provincial).&#160; British Columbia's combined tax is 12% (5% federal; 7% provincial).&#160; Also at this time Nova Scotia is increasing their rate to 15% HST.</li>
            <li><b>General Ledger account numbers</b> for tax paid will change.&#160; Please start using the new accounts as of July 01, 2010.&#160; The old accounts will no longer be available. The new accounts will be mapped to the <b>GST</b>, <b>HST</b>, <b>QST Tax Fields</b> in <b>SWeep</b> as of July 1, 2010.</li>

            <li><b>PST</b> penalized businesses by taxing at each step in production, distribution and retail. The new Ontario and British Columbia <b>HST</b> is a <b>value-added tax</b>, which means <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>, as a company, is refunded taxes paid on most expenses.&#160; It is important to code the tax in the proper fields in <b>SWEEP</b> so that <b>SW</b> may recognize these refunds or tax input credits. Click here to review the <a href="http://cpapp1.sherwin.com:81/policy/01.0/SWEEP_Canada_Messages/help.htm"><strong class="Strong">SWeep</strong><strong class="Strong"> Vendor Messages and Examples</strong></a>.</li>
            <li>Along with the benefits of <b>HST</b>, there are some restrictions.&#160;Stores were recently notified that <b>utility invoices</b> have been returned to the field to pay through <b>SWEEP</b>.&#160; The provincial portion of Ontario and British Columbia HST on utility invoices is a restricted tax that must be reported separately and therefore coded to a different <b>GL account</b>.</li>
            <li>When entering an invoice for a <b>utility or telecommunications vendor</b> in <b>SWEEP</b>, you will see "pop up" instructions on how to enter the tax.&#160; Only follow these instructions for these specific utility or telephone vendors.</li>
            <li>When this message for utility and telephone vendors appears, enter <b>5% Federal tax</b> in the <b>HST</b> tax box.&#160; Then let the remaining tax along with invoice amount default to the <b>Goods &amp; Services</b> field.&#160; Then on the distribution screen on page 2, enter the provincial portion of <b>HST</b> (8% tax for Ontario; 7% tax for British Columbia) to the account provided in the message.&#160; Accounts are also listed below:</li>
