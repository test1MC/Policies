        <h1>Tax Short Pay Overview</h1>
        <p>Some customers who claim exemptions, but do not provide supporting documentation may <b>“short pay”</b> their invoices by the amount of tax charged.&#160; The <b>Credit Center</b> will notify the store of customers who have “shorted” their invoice by the tax amount.&#160; </p>
