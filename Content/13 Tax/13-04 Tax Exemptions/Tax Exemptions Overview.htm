        <h1>Tax Exemptions Overview</h1>
        <p>It is <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>' policy and a legal requirement that all customers claiming a <b>sales tax exemption</b> must support their exemption in the form of current, fully, and correctly completed documentation as set forth by the requirements of the state in which the sale or delivery takes place.&#160; This documentation must be on file with <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>.&#160; </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typically, acceptable documentation will be a state tax <b>Exemption Certificate</b> issued to <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> and signed by the customer.&#160; If no documentation is provided, <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>' has a legal obligation to collect sales tax from the customer until a certificate is provided.&#160; </li>
            <li>For detailed information concerning the documents, certificates, types of customers, and types of exemptions permitted in the store's state, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../13-03 State Tax Bulletins/Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure.htm">Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure</MadCap:xref>.&#160; Be aware that separate bulletins exist for <b>TAG</b> and <b>Automotive</b> stores.&#160;These available certificates for the state will also be found in this chapter. </li>
            <p><i>Note:</i> Some states such as New York have several forms, each with a specific purpose such as resale, government, manufacturing, or contractor, for example.&#160;Other states, such as New Mexico have no certificates available in the manual as they are issued by the state directly to the taxpayer.&#160;Many states also allow use of the <b>Uniform Sales</b> and <b>Use Tax Multijurisdiction (Resale) Certificate</b>.&#160; The certificate shows the states which allow use of this form and which require their own state certificate to be used.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>For any questions regarding the collection of tax or completion of tax forms, please review the <a href="http://chameleon.sherwin.com/Corporate/tax">Corporate Tax Website</a>.&#160; This website contains forms, information, and contacts by issue to better serve the store's needs.</p>
