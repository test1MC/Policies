        <h1>Tax Record Card System Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 45pt;" start="1">
            <li>Entries in the <b>Tax Record Card System</b> <b>MUST</b> match the information the customer has provided on their tax exemption documentation or the Tax Record Card may be invalidated.&#160; </li>
            <li>If <b>01 Contractor</b> is selected as the <b>Reason</b> for an exemption, <b>Exempt Project Description</b> is required for the Tax Record Card to be valid.&#160; The <b>Exempt Project Description</b> must be specific to the project for which the exemption is being claimed.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>STORES USING JTRC SYSTEM ONLY (TEXAS)</b>:&#160; Tax Record Cards for non-contractor accounts should be assigned to the <b>01 House Account</b> if no corresponding <b>A/R Account</b> exists. </li>
            <li><b>STORES USING JTRC SYSTEM ONLY (TEXAS)</b>:&#160; All Tax Record Cards must be assigned to a corresponding <b>A/R Job Account</b>.&#160;Job account processing will require that contractors with job accounts claiming a tax exempt project have a Tax Record Card for each job which cannot be associated with the <b>01 House Account</b>. </li>
            <li><b>STORES USING JTRC SYSTEM ONLY (TEXAS)</b>:&#160; If a contractor is setting up a new tax-exempt job,  it is permitted to temporarily assign their Tax Record Card to the <b>01 House Account</b> while the <b>A/R job</b> is being approved.&#160; This assignment will have a grace period of five days after which you will need to associate the Tax Record Card with the correctly corresponding <b>A/R Account</b>.&#160;Three days after you have creating the Tax Record Card, the store will receive a reminder by e-mail to re-assign the job for the Tax Record Card. </li>
            <li><b>STORES USING JTRC SYSTEM ONLY (TEXAS)</b>:&#160; Note that a Tax Record Card may be connected to multiple jobs, but that each job may be connected to only one Tax Record Card.</li>
            <li>More than one Tax Record Card may be created for a customer account.&#160; For example, a contractor working on several tax exempt projects would be expected to submit a certificate (and the store to create a Tax Record Card) for each project.</li>
            <li>Once a Tax Record Card has been created, that Tax Record Card can be immediately accessed and used by any store.&#160; If a store employee believes a record may already exist, search existing Tax Record Cards by <b>TRC Number</b>, <b>Customer Account Number</b>, or <b>Customer Name</b> before creating a new Tax Record Card.</li>
            <li>The Tax Record Card System will generate a <b>Fax Coversheet</b> to be used when faxing the customer’s documentation to the <b>Tax Record Card Admin Group</b>.&#160; This coversheet <b>MUST</b> be used.&#160; If faxing support for more than one Tax Record Card, each one must be accompanied by its own coversheet.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Exemption Certificates</b> <b>MUST</b> be faxed to <b>Tax Record Card Administration</b> (using the fax number that prints on the fax coversheet that generates in the Tax Record Card System) within five days of Tax Record Card creation or the Tax Record Card will be invalidated by the system.</li>
            <li>While the actual <b>exemption certificate</b> must be retained, the fax coversheet generated by the <b>Tax Record Card System</b> may be discarded once faxed.</li>
            <li>If the customer provides separate forms for different states, <b>Tax Record Cards</b> should be submitted for each document.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
