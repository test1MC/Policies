        <h1>Tax Exempt Sales Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 45pt;" start="1">
            <li>Customers are required to have a valid <b>cash</b> or <b>charge account</b> for any tax exemption transaction. </li>
            <li>Since <b>Tax Record Cards</b> are available to all stores, there is no requirement to call the <b>home store</b> and request a copy of an exemption certificate to support a <b>tax exempt sale</b>.</li>
            <li>If the customer does not have documentation to support a <b>tax exempt sale</b>, the store employee must collect tax for the order/sale. It may be refunded later via a <b>correction transaction</b> in accordance with the state and local regulations once the customer provides documentation.</li>
            <li>All exempt sales must reference a <b>Tax Record Card</b>.</li>
            <li>Any store can create a <b>Tax Record Card</b> for any customer with support for <b>tax exemptions</b>; however, always retain any customer documentation received at the store.&#160;&#160; </li>
            <li>If the transaction is <b>job</b> or <b>project specific</b>, the <b>Tax Record Card</b> and receipt <b>MUST</b> reference the same <b>job name</b>.&#160; <b>Exempt transactions</b> made against the <b>01 House Job</b> must always be for the job named on the <b>Tax Record Card</b>. There are no exceptions or overrides.</li>
            <li>There are some gray areas with the <b>Taxability Rules Matrix</b> (please review <b>Product Taxability</b> in <MadCap:xref href="../13-01 Taxability/Determine Product Taxability Procedure.htm">Determine Product Taxability Procedure</MadCap:xref> where products purchased by an entity may be taxable or exempt based on the buyer’s end use of the product.)&#160; <ol style="margin-left: 45pt;list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1"><li>For example, sandpaper purchased by a manufacturer may be exempt if used in creating their end product for their customer but taxable if used in maintenance of their equipment.&#160; </li></ol></li>
            <li>A <b>Tax Record Card</b> must be established for a customer and applied to an order or sale in order to be able to perform a <b>Line Item Override</b>.<b>Line item overrides</b> will be monitored by the <b>Corporate Tax Department</b> and <b>Internal Audit</b>.</li>
