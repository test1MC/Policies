        <h1>Tax Exemption Certificate Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li><b>Tax exemption documentation</b> must be on file with  <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> in order to grant an exemption.</li>
            <li>All <b>certificates</b> must be complete and correct.&#160;Incomplete and/or incorrect certificates cannot be accepted for exemption purposes and tax must be charged.&#160;<b>Correct and complete certificates</b> will have the following information:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>The name on the customer’s certificate must match the name on <b>customer invoices</b>.</li><li>The <b>vendor</b> or <b>seller</b> on the certificate must be <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> or <b>Sherwin-Williams Automotive Finishes</b>.&#160;Automotive customers may submit certificates notes as <b>Sherwin-Williams</b>.&#160;This is acceptable as long it is signed after 1/1/1996.</li><li>A contractor who does not hold a resale permit <b>MUST</b> supply a specific <b>job name</b>.&#160; For example, “Church” is not acceptable while “First Baptist Church of Avon” is acceptable.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Usually, a <b>copy of a permit</b> may not be accepted as a substitute for a signed certificate.&#160; Please see <MadCap:xref href="../13-03 State Tax Bulletins/Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure.htm">Locate State Tax Bulletin Information Procedure</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li>The customer certificate must be for the state in which they take delivery.</li>
            <li>If no documentation is provided, <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> is legally obligated to collect <b>sales tax</b> from the customer until a certificate is provided.&#160; </li>
            <li>Store personnel are not permitted to complete <b>exemption certificates</b> or assist in the completion of exemption certificates by customers.&#160; The only part of an exemption certificate that a <b>Sherwin-Williams employee</b> may legally complete is <b>Sherwin-Williams' name and address</b>.</li>
            <li>Certificates are legal documents and may <b>never</b> be changed, altered, or updated by store personnel.&#160;Altering a customer’s exemption certificate can have serious consequences, including the possibility of <b>dismissal</b>.</li>
            <li>If a change is required or a certificate has expired, obtain a <b>new certificate</b> from the customer.&#160; Use the <b>Tax Exemption Request Letter</b> to communicate with the customer when they need updated exemption certificates for the file.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>If a customer changes their name, treat them as a new customer. First, complete a <b>new credit application</b> for the customer using their <b>new name</b>. Then, be sure to obtain a new exemption certificate in the customer's new name.</li>
            </ol>
