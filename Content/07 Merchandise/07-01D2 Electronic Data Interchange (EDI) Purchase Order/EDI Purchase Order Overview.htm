        <h1>EDI Purchase Order Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</b> provides a method of sending purchase orders electronically to the <b>Vendor</b> and receiving an <b>electronic confirmation of the purchase</b> from the <b>vendor</b>. If the vendor is <b>EDI-Capable</b>, this message will appear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"THIS VENDOR IS EDI-CAPABLE ORDER WILL BE SENT TO THE VENDOR ONCE THE PO IS RELEASED DO NOT CALL THE VENDOR TO PLACE THE ORDER."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will see the following message if the vendor is not <b>EDI-Capable</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"VENDOR IS NOT EDI-CAPABLE. MUST CALL VENDOR TO PLACE ORDER. &lt;OK&gt;"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While placing a Purchase Order you <b>MUST</b> make sure that you <b>RELEASE the Purchase Order</b>. The Purchase Order will not be automatically sent to the vendor until the Purchase Order is released.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Once a purchase order is RELEASED for a vendor that is able to receive purchase orders electronically, the purchase order will be transmitted to the vendor in one of the following time segments:</li>
