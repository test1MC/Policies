        <h1>EDI Purchase Order Acknowledgement Overview</h1>
        <p>To launch reports from any <b>POS screen</b>, press <b>Shift</b> + <b>INQUIRY  [F4]</b>. The <b>EDI Purchase Order Acknowledgment Report</b> provides you the <b>Accepted or Rejected status</b> of purchase orders placed with vendors. It is important to review this report frequently to understand the status of orders placed with vendors, and it is recommended that you print this report to see messages from the vendor. At the bottom of the report, the following messages will indicate appropriate next steps.</p>
