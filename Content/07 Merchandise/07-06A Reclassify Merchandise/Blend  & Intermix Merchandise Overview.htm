        <ul>
            <li>A <b>blend</b> is <b>custom-mixed paint</b> to match a special color at customer request. Such colors are not available from <b>Sherwin-William</b>s' standard custom mix charts. <b>Blends</b> are produced at blending stations, not at <b>Sherwin-Williams stores</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Blends</b> shipped to a store from a blending station are transferred by using an <b>Inter Store Transfer (IST) Transaction</b>.</li>
            <li>An <b>intermix</b> is a mix of two or more colors of the same product line. Sometimes colorants are also added to produce the required color. <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> has a <b>chart of standard intermixes</b> which are to be used as a guide in providing these colors for customers.</li>
            <li><b>Damaged goods</b> are sometimes intentionally ordered from a <b>Distribution Service Center</b> for sale at special, reduced prices. Stores can also order <b>manufactured merchandise</b> at a <b>special price</b> less than the listed cost.</li>
