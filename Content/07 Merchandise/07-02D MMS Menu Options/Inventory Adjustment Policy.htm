        <h1>Inventory Adjustment Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Only a <b>Level Four security employee</b> is permitted to process <b>Inventory Adjustments</b>. The <b>Manager</b> is not permitted to delegate <b>Level Four security</b> to someone else in <b>store management</b> without written <b>District Manager approval</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Inventory adjustments</b> should only be made for items received on <b>internal purchase orders</b>.&#160; A <b>Manual B-Prefix Purchase Order</b> should be used in place of an <b>inventory adjustment</b> for materials received on <b>external purchase orders</b> including situations where the <b>external purchase order</b> was:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Cancelled, but merchandise shipped.</li><li>Closed prior to receipt of <b>backordered merchandise</b>.</li><li>Closed having received a quantity lower than that actually received by the store.</li></ol></li>
            <li>No adjustments can be made once the Purchase Order is closed. If a receiving error is discovered after the Purchase Order has been received and closed, the same employee must perform an <b>Inventory Adjustment</b> capturing the received Purchase Order number in the <b>Purchase Order number field</b> on the <b>Inventory Adjustment</b>.</li>
            <li>An accurate reason must be entered in the memo field to support the adjustment. Once the adjustment has been made, the <b>perpetual inventory</b> is updated.</li>
            <li>Before processing an <b>Inventory Adjustment</b>, research the situation to ensure that an <b>Inventory Adjustment</b> is necessary. If after searching it cannot be determined if an item was stolen, process an <b>Inventory Adjustment</b>. Any <b>book value</b> will be recognized as <b>shrink</b> at inventory. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Do not process a <b>store expense</b> to <b>Theft</b> unless certain the merchandise was stolen.</li></ol></li>
            <li><b>Inventory adjustments</b> are only allowed on <b>inventoriable products</b>. <b>Non-inventoried products</b> such as stir sticks, merchandise bags, etc. cannot be adjusted.&#160; </li>
            <li><b>Southwestern Division Only</b>: <b>District Manager</b> or <b>District Financial Manager approval</b> must be obtained prior to processing a <b>perpetual adjustment</b> for either 80 gallons or more of a single <b>SKU</b>, or when a store needs to process an adjustment for a spray rig or any other piece of equipment that is tracked by serial number. This change does not apply if the store is also processing an equal and offsetting adjustment on another <b>SKU</b> to correct an error that occurred between the two.</li>
