        <h1>Cash for Trash - Five Gallon Pail Recycling Project Overview</h1>
        <h2>This program is currently available to stores only within the South Western Division serviced by the Waco DSC and within the Southeastern Division serviced by the Buford DSC or the Winter Haven DSC.</h2>
        <p>As a service to customers and to help avoid the transfer of <b>recyclable materials</b> to local landfills, Sherwin-Williams has established the <b>“Cash for Trash” 5 Gallon Pail recycling program</b>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage your customers to recycle their <b>empty plastic 5-gallon paint cans</b>. </li>
            <li>The customer will receive <b>twenty-five cents for each 5-gallon plastic container</b> returned for recycling and the store will be reimbursed for these credits provided that the established procedures are followed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note:&#160; This program is not intended to provide any significant profits to <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> – quite simply, it has been established because it is <b>the right thing to do</b>.</p>
