        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Pails are to be made of <b>HDPE plastic</b> with a <b>“2” recycle designation</b> on their bottom.</li>
            <li>Pails that originally contained <b>Sherwin-Williams paint</b> will receive the <b>$0.25 credit</b>. </li>
            <li>Pails that originally contained paint or drywall mud manufactured by a <b>company other than Sherwin-Williams</b> will be taken in and recycled, but no credit will be given. This is done as a service to the community.</li>
            <li>Pails must have residue only from <b>leftover latex paint</b> and not contain any <b>foreign material</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Empty</b> is defined as having leftover latex paint residue no more than <b>1/4’ thick</b> in the bottom of the pail.</li>
            <li><b>Dry</b> is defined as <b>no liquids of any kind</b> in the pail.</li>
            <li>It is the sole discretion of <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> whether the buckets are eligible for the <b>$0.25 credit</b> and if they meet the <b>dry and empty definitions</b>.</li>
