This type of stocking should only be used for <b>extremely stable customers</b> who will continue to use the product on a long-term basis.&#160; These products must have an <b>ordering pattern</b> repetitive enough to create a <b>forecast model</b>.&#160; The <b>District Manager</b> is required to file a new <b>Stocking Special Approval Form</b> for any <b>forecasted special</b> to be stocked in the <b>DSCs</b>. No forecast will be accepted for <b>amounts under 6000 gallons annually</b>. Once stock is confirmed <b>on-hand</b> in the <b>DSC</b>, order <b>Stocked Product Specials</b> by placing a <b>STAR Purchase Order</b> in <b>MMS</b>.</p>
