        <h1>Automotive Transfer to Mixing Room Policy</h1>
        <p>When <b>mixing toners</b> are removed from <b>warehouse inventory</b> and placed into the <b>Branch mixing room</b> (for use in intermixes), a <b>Transfer to the Mixing Room</b> transaction must be processed.&#160; Completing this transaction will properly account for branch usage and ensure accuracy of <b>branch perpetual inventory</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>A transaction must be processed through the <b>POS system</b> to record movement of product from the <b>warehouse</b> into the <b>mixing room</b>.</li>
            <li>A <b>Transfer to the Mixing Room transaction</b> must be processed in <b>POS</b> the same business day as a <b>new toner</b> or <b>empty can</b> is moved into the <b>mixing room</b>. To ensure that the transaction is not overlooked (or duplicated), the <b>Mixing Room Transfer and Expense Log</b> must be maintained of the toners being moved. <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Remove the <b>label</b> from the <b>empty toner can</b> and retain it as a reminder until the transaction has been completed.</li></ol></li>
            <li>A file must be maintained in the <b>branch</b> with copies of the <b>Transfer to Mixing Room transactions</b>. Once the <b>Mixing Room Transfer and Expense Log</b> is full, the completed log page should be filed with the <b>transaction copies</b>.</li>
            <li>Only product contained in a mix (toners, dryers, reducers, empty cans, etc.), and the can may be transferred into the <b>mixing room</b>. Do not transfer other <b>Associated Products</b> (clearcoat, gloves, etc.), to the <b>mixing room</b>.</li>
