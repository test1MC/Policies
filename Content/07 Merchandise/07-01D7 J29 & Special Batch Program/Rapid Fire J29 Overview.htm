        <h1>Rapid Fire J29 Overview</h1>
        <h2>This section applies to locations in EAD and SED divisions only</h2>
        <p><b>RapidFire</b> is the automated and streamlined process for the request, approval, and manufacture of <b>J29 products</b>. &#160;<b>RapidFire</b>’s <b>elimination of forms and manual administrative processes</b> will drastically reduce the time your customer waits to receive their product from weeks to days. &#160;<b>Rapidfire J29</b> has several benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eliminates all <b>J29 forms</b>, <b>special divisional policies</b>, <b>all approvals outside of District Manager</b></li>
            <li>Automates the <b>request and approval system</b> through <b>SOURCE</b> and alert emails when the product is ready</li>
            <li>Reduces the time between request and manufacture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your store will initiate both new and existing <b>J29 requests</b> for manufacture through a new <b>Customer Service Option</b> available in <b>Customer Order Entry</b> that will validate that bases, colors, sizes, and quantities for the <b>J29</b> are all within specifications. &#160;From the <b>Customer Order</b> the <b>J29</b> will be submitted for <b>District Manager approval</b>. &#160;Once approved, your order will automatically flow through the <b>manufacturing process</b>. &#160;You will receive an e-mail when your product is ready to order. </p>
