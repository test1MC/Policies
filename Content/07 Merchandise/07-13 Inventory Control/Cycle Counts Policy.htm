            <li>Stores have from Sunday through Saturday to record cycle counts for the week.&#160; The <b>cycle count process</b> may be completed as a single process or throughout the week.&#160; </li>
            <li>All <b>inventory variances</b> revealed in the <b>cycle count process</b> must be reconciled through the <b>Explain –Reconcile Variances</b> in <b>Cycle Counts</b> function on the <b>POS</b> by the Tuesday following the calendar week in which the <b>cycle count</b> was performed.</li>
            <li>It is critical to verify the accuracy of <b>shelf label pricing</b> while performing <b>cycle counts</b> and <b>correct inaccurate shelf labels</b> using <b>Shelf Labels on Demand</b> immediately.&#160; This is critical to avoid fines assessed by state and local agencies for displaying incorrect pricing.</li>

            <li>Employees are not required to perform <b>cycle counts</b> if the store computer system is not working properly because there is no <b>downtime cycle counting process</b>. As soon as the computer system is operating properly, resume <b>cycle counts</b>.</li>
