                        <p>Note: The scanner is the fastest and most efficient way to receive your order. It also reduces the chances of making mistakes when receiving an order. The moment an <b>Advanced Shipping Notification (ASN)</b> is scanned, all the information is immediately sent to the <b>Merchandise Management purchase order</b> on the store’s system. If receiving against the purchase order at a <b>SOURCE terminal</b> instead of using the <b>Handheld Scanner</b>, ensure that you either scan the <b>ASN Barcode</b> or manually enter the <b>ASN number</b> for each received pallet.</p>
