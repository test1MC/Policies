        <h1>Receive STAR Order Overview</h1>
        <p>The following information provides an overview for the <b>STAR Order receiving process</b> and the automatic generation of <b>Visible Shortage</b> and <b>Visible Damage IBAR</b>'s. If <b>visibly damaged </b>or<b> visibly missing products</b> are detected during delivery, the receiving employee must identify and document the <b>damaged or missing products</b>. The delivery driver and receiving employee must sign the <b>system-generated Shipment Variance Report</b> and <b>BOL</b> noting the damaged or missing products. </p>
        <p><b>Visible Damage</b> could include: paint leaking from the bottom of the pallet - the receiving employee should locate the source of the paint leak or crushed boxes - the receiving employee should open the entire box to inspect each piece</p>
        <p><b>Visible Missing products</b> would include products missing from received quantities, but <b>WOULD NOT INCLUDE Visible Missing products</b> from a pallet if the <b>ASN WAS NOT scanned.</b>&#160; If you notice missing product and you have received the order by product/line, process an <b>IBAR for Concealed Damage / Shortage / Overage</b>.</p>
