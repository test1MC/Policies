        <h1>Promo Property Listing FA217 Overview</h1>
        <h2>This section applies to Automotive Branches only</h2>
        <p>This report details all of the approved capitalized promotional equipment that has been provided to our customers over the years.&#160; You will find details on the report such as the <b>customer name</b>, <b>ePromo number</b>, <b>original cost</b>, and <b>net book value</b> of each piece of promotional equipment that is currently assigned to your branch.&#160; It is available on the <b>Automotive Field Reports</b> website and is published on a monthly basis.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 9pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">This field report needs to be referenced each time you are filling out a <b>new ePromo</b> that involves providing a customer with <b>transferred equipment.</b>&#160; This will allow us to capture the most accurate <b>NBV</b> and it should help more accurately estimate the equipment's worth.&#160; </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the equipment being transferred is listed on this field report, fill out a <b>Promotional Merch Transfer/Retirement</b> and either attach in the <b>ePromo</b> or submit to <b>Accounting</b>.&#160; </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Even if the branch number is not changing and the equipment is moving from one customer to another, this form still needs to be filled out.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure when filling out the form you list the asset number for each item, and if the equipment being transferred is not listed on the <b>Promo Property Listing FA217 report</b>, do not list it on the form because it is not approved capitalized equipment.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure equipment is properly assigned to your branch in order to confirm you are being charged with the correct monthly amortization, which hits the <b>P&amp;L</b> on line 34, <b>MGN ADJ - Promo Expense</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">This report is different than the normal property listing; this report only shows approved capitalized promotional equipment.&#160; You should continue to also review your normal property listing for fixed assets within the branch.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When reviewing the monthly report, if you think a change in assignment on certain equipment is necessary, please send an email to <a href="mailto:kathleen.m.dickey@sherwin.com">kathleen.m.dickey@sherwin.com</a> or call <b>Kathleen Dickey (216-566-3136)</b>. In the email, advise what asset number you are referring to and where the equipment should properly go.&#160; </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Before any promotional equipment is moved to a new branch, that new branch will be contacted to ensure the equipment re-assignment is accurate.</li>
