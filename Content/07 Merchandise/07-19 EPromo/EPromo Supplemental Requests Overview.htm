        <h1>EPromo Supplemental Requests Overview</h1>
        <p>In the event additional equipment and/or paint or consignment needs to be placed with a customer subsequent to the original placement, a <b>supplemental ePromo request</b> will need to be submitted if the following criterion is met:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 9pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Within one year of the original placement </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Total dollar amount of the <b>supplemental request</b> is greater than $500 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create the <b>supplemental request</b>, follow the same steps as creating the original <b>ePromo</b>.&#160; All additional equipment given to the customer should be entered on the <b>ePromo</b>, and the <b>Supplemental Request</b> section near the bottom left of the form will need to be completed.&#160; The original approved promotional number and amount of the original promo will need to be entered in this area.&#160; Approval will be routed according to the total amount of the original and supplemental request.</p>
        <p><i>Note:</i> If the <b>ePromo</b> is more than 1 year from the original request, a new <b>ePromo</b> should be created (non-supplemental).</p>
