        <h1>Record Damaged Freight on the Delivery Receipt Procedure</h1>
        <p>When the carrier picks up the material at the <b>Distribution Center</b>, they sign for and accept the accuracy of the piece count that appears on the <strong class="Strong">Bill-of-Lading</strong>. The <b>Branch</b> receives a<strong class="Strong"> Delivery Receipt</strong> or <strong class="Strong">Freight Bill</strong> with the shipment that also shows the total number of pieces that were given to the carrier, which the carrier prepares from the <b>Distribution Center Bill-of-Lading</b>. When the material is delivered, the Branch will be asked to sign the <strong class="Strong">Delivery Receipt</strong>.</p>
