            <li>All <b>physically received</b> merchandise must be tied to a <b>Purchase Order</b>. All items must be received against a <b>Purchase Order</b> on the store computer system within 24 hours of physical receipt. </li>
            <li>All items must be sales number [<b>SKU</b>] controlled at the store location in order to maintain accurate unit movement and inventory value. The <b>manufacturer part number</b>, when available, should be included when establishing a <b>sales number</b>.</li>

            <li>Additional items must be received against a <b>Purchase Order</b> even if they were not originally ordered.</li>
            <li><b>Free</b> or <b>No Charge</b> merchandise must be placed on the same purchase order with the merchandise that qualifies you for the <b>Free</b> or <b>No Charge</b> merchandise. The <b>promotion name</b> must be noted in the <b>COMMENTS [F9]</b> section of the free line item. This is necessary for proper <b>pricing</b> of the promotional line item. Additional "free" merchandise at your regular cost must be placed on a separate purchase order because the sales number already appears on the purchase order at a zero cost. </li>
