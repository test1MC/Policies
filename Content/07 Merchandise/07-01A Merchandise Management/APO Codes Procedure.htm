        <h1>APO Codes Procedure</h1>
        <p><b>APO Codes</b> are assigned to each product in the <b>Master Product File</b> and identify the source of a product as internal or external.&#160; Products coded as external may only be ordered on an external purchase orders.&#160; Products available internally (including vendor products stocked at the <b>DSC</b>) may only be ordered on internal purchase order types.&#160; The <b>APO Code</b> also controls which products may be maintained for <b>Min / Max</b> order points.&#160; Products which have been assigned an <b>APO Code</b>, which is allowable for <b>STAR Orders</b>, will also be eligible for <b>Min / Max Maintenance</b>.&#160; If a product’s <b>APO Code</b> assignment does not allow the product to be ordered using <b>STAR Orders</b>, that product is not eligible for <b>Min / Max Maintenance</b>.</p>
        <p>To review which <b>APO Codes</b> are associated with external purchase orders and those which are associated with internal purchase order types, stores should access the <b>View Allowable Purchase Order (APO) Codes Report</b> in <b>Merchandise Management Reports</b>.&#160; This report will show the same information displayed in the chart below:</p>
