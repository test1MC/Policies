        <h1>Min &amp; Max Inventory Program Overview</h1>
        <p>Sherwin-Williams utilizes a <b>Min/Max Inventory Program</b> as part of its <b>Store Level Replenishment (SLR) system</b>.&#160; A <b>Min/Max program</b> establishes an inventory level threshold that will automatically include an item on a <b>Suggested Star Order</b> once the <b>Min level</b> has been reached.&#160;The <b>Suggested Star Order</b> will include a quantity up to the <b>Max level</b> on the <b>Purchase Order</b>.</p>
        <p>There are many benefits to the <b>Min/Max Inventory System</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The process is automated, saving time when placing orders</li>
            <li>Helps keep store costs down by reducing excess inventory</li>
            <li>Greater item availability for selling</li>
            <li>Prevents stores from accidentally omitting items on orders</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Establishing and maintaining accurate <b>Min/Max and Perpetual Inventory levels</b> is key to Sherwin’s <b>Inventory Optimization program</b>.&#160;This program is a joint effort by both <b>Store Managers</b> and the <b>Stores Operations Team</b> in Cleveland.&#160;The <b>Stores Operation Team</b> in Cleveland will review and adjust the <b>Min/Max levels</b> at each store based on dramatic changes in demand either up or down. <b>Managers</b> are encouraged to contact their <b>Division Inventory System Analyst</b> with questions. Make the necessary <b>min/max adjustments</b> required to maintain <b>Trademark Customer Service levels</b> in your store while also remaining cognizant of <b>expense containment obligations</b>.&#160;When making a <b>min/max adjustment</b>,  enter a <b>reason code</b>.&#160;This is intended to provide real-time market intelligence to the <b>Stores Operations</b> team in Cleveland to ensure accurate <b>store level sales forecasts</b> for the product.&#160; The more information provided the better the <b>Store Operations</b> team's ability to take the action required to ensure your input is utilized.</p>
        <p>Good communication between the two groups ensures accurate levels to meet customer needs and minimize excess inventory costs.  These levels are set by looking at historical sales trends at the store <b>SKU</b> level with more weight given to current sales trends.</p>
        <p>Stores have the flexibility to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set or change <b>Min/Max levels</b> based on need</li>
            <li>Create a <b>Memo Demand</b></li>
            <li>Place an <b>Emergency Order</b></li>
            <li>Adjust order quantities on a <b>PO</b></li>
            <li>Import outside buys suggested on the <b>Non-STAR worksheet</b> into a <b>PO</b></li>
        </ul>
