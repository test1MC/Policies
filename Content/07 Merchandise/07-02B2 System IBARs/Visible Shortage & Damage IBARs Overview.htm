        <h1>Visible Shortage &amp; Damage IBARs Overview</h1>
        <p>The system generates <b>IBARs</b> for visible shortages and visible damage discovered during receipt.&#160;This provides many benefits to the stores:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paperless - no <b>IBAR</b> or supporting documentation needs to be sent to <b>Headquarters</b> if store employee accurately documents shortages/damages and has driver's signature.</li>
            <li>Faster <b>approval/disapproval</b> and <b>credit</b>. </li>
            <li>Easier receiving and greater chance of having the driver stay for <b>pallet receiving</b> so the driver can sign for any <b>Visible Shortage/Damage</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <b>system-generated IBAR</b> is created for any visibly damaged or visibly shorted product have identified while receiving the <b>STAR Order</b> once the <b>STAR Purchase Order</b> is closed.&#160; In order to receive credit for these, the <b>IBAR</b> must be reviewed and released by a member of <b>store management</b>.</p>
