        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1">
            <li><b>MMS IBARS</b> must be reviewed upon receipt of an <b>email notification</b> that an <b>MMS IBAR</b> has been generated for the store. </li>
            <li>After reviewing, the <b>MMS IBAR Questionnaire – STORE RESPONSE</b> must be completed within 7 days of the <b>IBAR Trans Date</b> shown on the <b>MMS IBARS Inquiry</b> through <b>My Paint</b>. If the 7 day time period has expired, the response must be completed immediately upon review of the entry on the <b>MMS IBARS Inquiry</b> in order to avoid <b>IBAR shrinkage expense</b> being booked to the store unnecessarily.</li>
