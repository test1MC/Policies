        <h1>Inter-Store Request Policy</h1>
        <p>An <b>Inter Store Request (ISR) Purchase Order</b> is a request to receive merchandise from another <b>Sherwin-Williams location</b>, which often allows for easier and faster results. <b>ISR Purchase Orders</b> are not sent via <b>EDI</b> to the <b>transferring store</b>. For information on creating an <b>ISR</b> to request a special <b>Product Finishes Blend</b>, please see <a href="file:///S:/METHSHAR/intranetpublishedsites/policy/MADCAP/Content/Mackenzie/Updated/07-01D4 Internal Purchase Order Types.doc#ccisr">CC Blend ISR</a>. For information on creating an <b>ISR</b> to request an <b>Automotive Special Blend</b>, please see <a href="file:///S:/METHSHAR/intranetpublishedsites/policy/MADCAP/Content/Mackenzie/Updated/07-01D4 Internal Purchase Order Types.doc#autoblend">Automotive Special Blend Order</a>.&#160;&#160; </p>

            <li>An <b>ISR</b> must be processed anytime you choose to get merchandise from another <b>Sherwin-Williams store</b>.</li>
            <li>Merchandise may not be transferred between stores without the agreement of both participating <b>Store Managers</b> or <b>specific instructions from the District Manager</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Class Numbers</b> and <b>Sales Numbers</b> can be entered several times on an <b>ISR</b> after specifically identifying them with a unique <b>descriptor</b>.</li>
            <li>You will be required to enter a cost for any <b>merchandise purchase vendor direct</b> on an <b>ISR</b>. Don't leave the cost at zero (0.00) on this merchandise. It is critical that the <b>sending and receiving store employees</b> agree upon a cost when completing the <b>ISR</b> and <b>IST</b>, which will print on outside buy purchased products if entered.</li>
            <li>An <b>ISR Purchase Order</b> needs to be created for products requested from each shipping store. The <b>system generated ISR Purchase Order Number</b> must be communicated to the shipping store for documentation (via fax), as this information is included in creation of the <b>Inter Store Transfer [IST] transaction</b>. You are not required to retain a manual copy of the <b>ISR</b>. The store computer system will match the <b>ISR</b> to the <b>IST</b>.&#160; For additional information on the <b>IST process</b>, please refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../08 Point of Sale Transactions/08-14 Inter Store Transfer (IST)/Inter Store Transfer (IST) Overview.htm">Inter Store Transfer (IST) Overview</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Once the merchandise is at your location, you must receive the merchandise against the <b>ISR</b> in order to properly adjust the inventory. </li>
            <li>Include any <b>freight or shipping charges</b>. Freight charges are allocated back to the <b>unit cost</b> for <b>WAC-costed products</b> only. If the product being transferred is a standard cost product, the freight charges will be expensed.</li>
            <li>The <b>shipping store</b> is responsible for completing the <b>Bill of Lading process</b>.</li>
