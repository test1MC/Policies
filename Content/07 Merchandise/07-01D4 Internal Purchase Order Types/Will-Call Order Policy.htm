        <h1>Will-Call Order Policy</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive Branches<br /></h2>
        <p>The <b>Will-Call Order</b> allows for stores to place orders directly with the <b>DSC</b> for <b>store or customer pickup</b>. No call to <b>Customer Service</b> is required unless you are requesting a <b>special batch</b> or you require a pick-up earlier than<b>4.5 hours</b> from the time the order is released in <b>POS</b>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li><b>Will-Call orders</b> have an order size limit of <b>5 order lines</b> or less and require <b>Date and Time</b> entry indicating when the order will be picked up at the <b>DSC</b>. </li>
            <li>There is a <b>4.5 hour</b> lead time for <b>Will-Call Orders</b>. This means that orders placed for <b>Will-Call</b> will not be ready for pickup for <b>4.5 hours</b> from the time the order is released in <b>SOURCE</b>.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><b>South Western Division stores</b> – <b>Will-Call Orders</b> must be approved by the <b>District</b> or <b>District Financial Manager</b> prior to being placed.</li></ol></li>
            <li>The order must be received by the <b>DSC</b> by <b>4PM EST</b> for <b>Same Day pickup</b>. Orders must be picked up at the <b>DSC</b> by <b>9PM EST</b>. </li>
            <li><b>Will-Call orders</b> must be picked up by either <b>Store personnel</b> or the <b>customer</b> directly. If a store wishes to send in a <b>carrier</b> to pick up the order, the order is not a <b>Will-Call order</b>. The store must place an <a href="file:///S:/METHSHAR/intranetpublishedsites/policy/MADCAP/Content/Mackenzie/Updated/07-01D4 Internal Purchase Order Types.doc#emergency">Emergency Order</a>, call <b>Customer Service</b>, and pay for the freight or the shipment will ship on the <b>normal LTL trucks</b>.</li>
