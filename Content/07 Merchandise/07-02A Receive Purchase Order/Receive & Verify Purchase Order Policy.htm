            <li>Make sure to accept the receipts with the <b>proper quantity</b> and <b>unit cost</b> as soon as possible. An employee could be presented with invoices from vendors with <b>valid purchase orders</b> when there is no receiving information on file. This could mean that the merchandise is at the store, but it has not been received on the system. </li>
            <li>If the store employee has at least <b>Level 2 MMS Security</b>, they must approve each line item variance before the whole <b>Purchase Order</b> can be <b>approved</b> as <b>received</b>.

            <li>Each line must be designated as complete&#160; to close the <b>Purchase Order</b>. You must have at least <b>Level 2 MMS Security</b> to close <b>Internal Purchase Orders</b>. It is the <b>Store Manager</b>'s responsibility to <b>verify and close external Purchase Orders</b>.</li>

Any quantity or pricing discrepancies between the received <b>Purchase Order</b> and the <b>vendor's invoice</b> will result in an automatic <b>chargeback</b> generated by <b>Headquarters</b>. </li>
            <li>For <b>internally purchased products</b>, the system will automatically match received <b>Purchase Orders</b> to the <b>invoices</b>. </li>
            <li><b>Serial Numbers</b> for <b>spray equipment</b> must be captured during the <b>receiving process</b>. Other <b>special product identification information</b> must be captured in the <b>Special Instructions</b> area. (If serial numbers are not recorded during receiving, you will not be able to sell the merchandise.)</li>
            <li><b>Automotive Branches</b> must record <b>serial numbers</b> for products listed on the <b>Serial Numbered Products Listing</b>. Find the <b>Serial Numbered Products listing</b> in the <b>Forms Repository</b>. </li>
            <li><b>Actual freight</b> must be entered at receiving.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>The <b>received freight amount</b> is booked to inventory.</li><li>The difference between invoiced and received freight goes to <b>freight variance (margin) account</b>.</li><li>Freight is allocated back over all received products proportionately</li><li>If you place one purchase order and received several deliveries, make sure that you adjust the <b>current freight charges</b> to reflect only the merchandise that is being received. </li></ol></li>
            <li>Receiving takes the place of reviewing the <b>Stores Purchases Report (SPR)</b> for merchandise. You are still required to review <b>expense items</b> on the <b>Stores Purchases Report</b>. </li>
