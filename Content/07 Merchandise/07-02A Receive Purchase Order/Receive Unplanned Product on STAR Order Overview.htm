        <h1>Receive Unplanned Product on STAR Order Overview</h1>
        <p>Occasionally, a store will receive a product on their <b>STAR</b> that they did not order.&#160; Sometimes, this is planned by <b>Sherwin-Williams</b> through the <b>DSCs</b> as a <b>Marketing Promotional Shipment</b>.&#160; Every attempt is made to notify the stores when this is taking place, but occasionally it arrives unexpectedly.&#160; Other times, a product is shipped to the store as a <b>replacement product</b>- this means that a <b>new SKU</b> has replaced an <b>existing SKU</b> that had been ordered.&#160;&#160;There could be several reasons for this including a newer version of the product has been introduced or a product has been discontinued.&#160; </p>
        <p>When a product has been replaced, the store is made aware of this on their <b>Order Advisory Report</b> found in <b>MMS</b>.&#160; This will often show the <b>SKU</b> that has been sent in its place.&#160; It is vital that the <b>Store Manager</b> check and ensure that any <b>discontinued product</b> has been zeroed out in <b>Min/Max</b>.&#160;&#160; If this does not happen, the product may continue to appear on the <b>Suggested STAR</b> and ship into the store.&#160; The reason for this is because the <b>Perpetual Inventory</b> will continue to show you are under the <b>Min amount</b> set since you are not actually receiving the initial product in, only the replacement product.&#160; Be sure to verify that the replacement product also has a <b>Min/Max</b> established. <b>Customer Service</b> can help determine the problem if you need assistance with the <b>Order Advisory Report</b>.&#160;The <b>Order Advisory Report</b> can be accessed from your <b>MMS Reports</b> section.&#160; </p>
