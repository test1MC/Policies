        <h1>External Purchase Order Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>The only way to place orders for inventory is through the <b>Purchase Order functionality</b> in <b>MMS</b>. Stores are not to purchase inventory through any other means including online ordering, payment by credit card, or payment by <b>Store Draft</b>.</li>
            <li>A <b>store manager</b> has the authority to place external purchase orders up to $10,000.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Any <b>external purchase order</b> over the $10,000 limit must have written <b>District Manager approval</b> on file, prior to placing the order with the vendor. Two or more purchase orders placed within 7 days to the same vendor and totaling more than $10,000 must have written <b>District Manager approval</b> prior to placing the purchase order that would take the total over $10,000. Approvals for purchase orders over the approval limit must be retained for eighteen months from date of the purchase order. This approval level does not apply to <b>Automotive Branches</b>, <b>PFG Facilities</b>, <b>Floorcovering Facilities</b>, nor floorcovering purchases by <b>TAG locations</b>.</li><li><b>Free</b> or <b>No Charge merchandise</b> must be placed on the qualifying purchase order but with a different sales number. The promotion name must be noted in the comments section of the free line item, which is necessary for proper pricing. Additional <b>free merchandise</b> at regular cost must be placed on a separate purchase order because the sales number already appears on the purchase order at a zero cost.</li><li>Orders for an individual customer must be placed within 24 hours of processing the deposit. If the sale involves installation, do not place the order until the <b>Rescission Notice</b> expires. The <b>Rescission Notice Policy</b> does not apply to <b>Automotive Branches</b>.</li><li>The merchandise must be labeled with the sales number and selling price if it will be stocked on the sales floor. Refer to the <b>Inventory Price List</b> if the manufacturer’s suggested selling price was not entered as the <b>selling price</b> on the <b>Purchase Order</b>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../07-02D MMS Menu Options/Inventory Price List Policy.htm">Inventory Price List Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Regardless of where you get the product, the same sales number should be used to order, receive, label, and sell each product.</li>
            <li>Because <b>class numbers</b> allow you to provide definition as to what product you want rather than a direct relational tie as we have with <b>sales numbers</b>, it is possible to mis-use and order other products under these numbers. This should not be done.</li>
            <li>It is the <b>Store Manager</b>'s responsibility to review and take appropriate action on all <b>Purchase Orders</b>.</li>
            <li>All merchandise vendors must have established <b>Credit Accounts</b> and be paid through <b>Accounts Payable</b>. Find an alternative source if the vendor is not willing to establish credit terms with the Company. </li>
            <li>The <b>Credit Application</b> must be faxed to <b>Accounts Payable</b> at <b>Headquarters (FAX 216-566-3939)</b>. <b>For more information, see</b> <MadCap:xref href="../../01 Accounting &amp; Filing/01-03A SWeep Expense Transmittals/New Vendor Request Procedure.htm">New Vendor Request Procedure</MadCap:xref>.</li>
