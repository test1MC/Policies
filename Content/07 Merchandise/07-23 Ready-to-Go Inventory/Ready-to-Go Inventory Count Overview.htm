        <h1>Ready-to-Go Inventory Count Overview</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the <b>RTG count</b> is to bring awareness to <b>inventory on hand</b> that will be approaching <b>Shelf Life expiration</b>, determined by <b>product batch date</b>. This process is meant to assist with <b>inventory management</b> and <b>stock rotation</b> (sell <b>RTG inventory</b> first). There is a designated timeframe to review <b>on-hand inventory</b> and enter the counts based on the criteria below. If items identified as <b>RTG</b> are not sold before <b>November Physical Inventory</b>, they will be counted as <b>current year obsolescence</b> and the branch will incur the <b>obsolescence expense</b>.</p>
