        <h1>IBAR Goods Transfer Overview</h1>
        <p>Stores may select to transfer goods to a non-store within or outside of <b>The Americas Group</b>, typically a <b>non-selling locatio</b>n used by <b>administrative cost centers</b>, which should be charged to <b>administrative expense</b>. Benefits of using this process to transfer material are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Paperless</b> – no <b>IBAR</b> or supporting documentation needs to be sent to <b>Headquarters</b> as long as all required information is provided.</li>
            <li><b>Faster</b> approval, limited disapproval.</li>
        </ul>
