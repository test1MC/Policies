        <h1>Concealed IBAR Overview</h1>
        <p>A <b>Concealed Damage, Shortage or Overage</b> problem typically is identified while putting away the <b>STAR order</b>. Usually, these are items in repacked boxes or small packages that were not included during shrink wrapping at the <b>DSC</b>. A <b>Concealed Damage, Shortage or Overage IBAR</b> does not result in a return of goods to the <b>DSC</b>; however, it does result in a credit to the store or <b>Paint &amp; Coatings</b>.&#160; </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Concealed Shortage</b>: Store ordered product “A” and was shipped product “A” but did not receive the entire shipment.</li>
            <li><b>Concealed Overaged</b>: Stored ordered product “A” but received more than the quantity shipped.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <b>Concealed Damage/ Shortage / Overage IBAR</b> can also be generated for merchandise that a store was billed for but never received.&#160; The process provides many benefits, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No <b>IBAR mailing</b> with support will need to be sent to <b>Headquarters</b>.</li>
            <li>Tracking mechanisms are used so performance can be gauged at both the store and <b>DSC</b> level.</li>
            <li>Credit is automatic.</li>
        </ul>
