        <h1>Internal Purchase Orders Overview</h1>
        <p>All internal order types will now be submitted for fulfillment using <b>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</b>. There are some exceptions to this rule requiring phone calls to <b>Customer Service</b>; however, these scenarios have been greatly reduced. The <b>VRU</b> has been eliminated as a method for submitting orders. These new ordering procedures will result in many benefits for stores: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stores have become more empowered in their <b>ordering procedures</b>.</li>
            <li>With certain exceptions, phone calls will not need to be made to <b>Customer Service</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Customer Service</b> will be better able to handle <b>order exceptions</b> and <b>special orders</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>DSC</b> will receive <b>orders</b> within minutes rather than overnight.</li>
            <li>The <b>Plants</b> will be able to anticipate customer demand earlier.</li>
            <li><b>Order Advisory Reports</b> will be received within hours of placing an order rather than next day.</li>
            <li><b>Additional Order Types</b> will allow for entry of <b>Will Call</b> and <b>Make-N-Ship orders</b> into the <b>SOURCE</b> system.</li>
            <li><b>Line Item Comments</b> and <b>Special Instructions information</b> will be sent to the <b>DSC</b>.</li>
            <li><b>Naming conventions for order types</b> have been standardized <b>between Stores Group business units</b> and <b>Consumer Division</b>.</li>
        </ul>
