                        <p>Note: A sale transaction is almost identical to a customer order. However, since customer service and tinting are not available in the sale, the transaction has limited use as a starting point for any transaction.&#160;Typically users will pull their <b>Customer Order</b> into a sale transaction to complete the billing.</p>

        <p>No matter how a customer’s request is recorded initially, it is completed with a <b>Point-of-Sale Transaction</b>.&#160; </p>
        <p>Note: All orders requiring tint must be initiated through <b>COE</b> or <b>Quick Order</b>. Tinted product is not returnable, however, it can be adjusted for customer satisfaction.</p>
