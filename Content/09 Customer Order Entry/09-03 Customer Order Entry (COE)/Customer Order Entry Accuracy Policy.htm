        <h1>Customer Order Entry Accuracy Policy</h1>
        <p>Customer service improves and <b>Point-of-sale transactions</b> are processed more quickly when the customer order is accurate and contains the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Required Date</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Selling Price</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Comments</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 27pt;" start="1">
            <li>Employees must enter the date <b>(REQUIRED)</b> that the customer needs the product.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>It is important to enter an accurate date because internal products could be automatically placed on a <b>Memo Demand</b> and added to your next <b>Suggested STAR Order</b> if not currently available in your store. </li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>External products</b> and those <b>Internal products</b> that are required before your next <b>STAR delivery date</b> will print on an <b>ITEMS TO BE ORDERED report</b> when you finish the current order.</li>
            <li>Employees are required to place orders for products on the <b>Items to be Ordered Report</b>. One of the future enhancements to <b>Customer Order Entry</b> will be the automatic generation of <b>Internal and External Purchase Orders</b>.</li>
            <li>Employees must ensure that the customer's price is accurate while processing the order. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Discount information can be brought into the sale by pressing the <b>Discount (DISC) key</b>. <b>Point of sale pricing</b> will not be automatic for any customer order item with a zero (0) selling price. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Employees must only enter appropriate comments on <b>point-of-sale transactions</b> and <b>customer orders</b> because all comments print on customer invoices and statements. Any racial, ethnic, or derogatory remark entered on a <b>point-of-sale transaction</b> or <b>customer order</b> is considered <b>Gross Misconduct</b> and usually results in termination.</li>
        </ol>
