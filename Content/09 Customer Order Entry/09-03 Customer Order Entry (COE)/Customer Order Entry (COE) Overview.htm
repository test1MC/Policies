        <h1>Customer Order Entry (COE) Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Customer Order Entry</b> enables users to receive electronic orders and enter customer orders on the store computer system. You are able to create a printed copy of the order to be used as a <b>picking ticket</b> or <b>tinting order</b>. <b>Order Disposition</b> shows orders that are still pending in the <b>Customer Order Entry Order Queue</b> that are to be reviewed by the store manager. Once the order is ready for customer pick-up or delivery, you are able to update the original order with any formula or product information. When the customer comes into the store, you are able to quickly apply the order to a sales transaction without re-entering the information. When the process is complete, the original order is tied to the <b>point of sale transaction</b>.</p>
        <p><b>Customer Order Entry</b> also provides more accurate inventory. While processing an order, the inventory is updated to reflect the committed products. Once the inventory is updated, you are able to perform product inquiries and see exactly how much product is committed and available for sale. If there is not enough product at your location or the customer has repeating orders for the same product,  enter the product several times on the customer order with appropriate required dates and the system will automatically place <b>DSC merchandise</b> on the next <b>Suggested STAR Order</b> through an <b>Automatic Memo Demand</b>. This  <b>Automatic Memo Demand</b> will be considered for <b>STAR Orders</b> with delivery dates closest to the required date. </p>
        <p>If the next <b>STAR order</b> does not come before the required date, the information will print on a reminder report titled <b>ITEMS TO BE ORDERED</b> when you exit <b>Order Entry</b>. The order process for out of stock merchandise will be completely automated in one of the future phases of <b>Customer Order Entry</b>.</p>
        <p>When you receive merchandise against a purchase order that is needed to fill an order, a report titled <b>CUSTOMER ORDER ENTRY ITEMS RECEIVED</b> will automatically print. Use this report to identify and fill outstanding orders. Please use a <b>Product Order Form</b>, located in the <b>Forms Repository</b>, if the computer system is not working properly. As soon as the system is operational, enter the information into the system.</p>
        <p>The <b>Order Entry menu</b> contains the following options for creating and maintaining orders on the store computer system:</p>
