        <h1>Service Center Transfer Order Policy</h1>
        <h2>This does not apply to Automotive, General Polymers, MAB Paints, or SW Paint Stores (only select SW Paint Stores have access to the Transfer Order process).</h2>

        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Always review <b>Special Instructions</b> to note whether or not the customer order must be fulfilled complete.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>If a store location mistakenly transfers an order to you, re-transfer the order back to that location via the <b>IST process</b>. </li>
                <li>If you are unable to fulfill an order line, must change an order line quantity, or the customer requests additional product, must modify the customer order to reflect these changes and them in <b>Special Instructions</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Transfer Orders</b> are not to be used to replenish store stock. Store stock replenishment must be completed via an <b>IST</b> request between stores or a <b>STAR Order</b> against the warehouse. </li>
            <li>A transfer order should meet one or more of the following requirements:</li>
