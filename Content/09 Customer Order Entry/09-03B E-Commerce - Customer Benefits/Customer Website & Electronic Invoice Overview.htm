        <h1>Customer Website &amp; Electronic Invoice Overview</h1>
        <p>In a web based process, the customer will give the suppliers access to a website. This is a manual process which requires our stores to log into the customer’s designated site. Once the suppliers have accessed the site, they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Review and print <b>POs</b> </li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Perform <b>PO acknowledgments</b></li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Submit invoices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customers who have elected to receive their invoices electronically can do so by contacting the <b>Stores E-Commerce Department</b> by email <a href="mailto:edi.stores@sherwin.com?subject=EDI%20Question">edi.stores@sherwin.com</a> or by phone 216-515-8998.&#160;The customer may choose to receive their invoices as an attachment <b>.CSV</b> or .<b>PDF file</b>  on a system generated email or  directly through a system generated electronic format (i.e. EDI or xml).&#160; </p>
        <p>Customers using the email option require account numbers to be added to their file so that the correct account receives  invoices for the correct  email address.&#160;Customers electing to receive their invoices directly will require setup and testing with the implementation group in the <b>Stores E-Commerce Department</b>.</p>
        <p>If the customer requests a previously billed invoice to be resent electronically, please contact the <b>Stores E-Commerce Department</b> with the transaction number and transaction date.&#160; </p>

        <p>Note: Even though Sherwin-Williams can send invoices and credit invoices, it cannot send price corrections to the customer. When pricing needs to be corrected, a complete credit and re-bill at the correct price is required. If a pricing issues persists (reconciling <b>PRC</b> versus <b>catalog</b> or <b>price billed</b>), please contact <b>Stores E-Commerce Department</b> and have the account number, account name, sales numbers, the parent name, and parent number (if available). The <b>E-Commerce Department</b> will work with the customer, the sales contact, and national accounts to make the correct adjustments to the <b>PRC</b> or <b>electronic catalog</b>.&#160;Once the appropriate edits are completed, there may be corrective transactions to be run by the Sherwin-Williams store.</p>
