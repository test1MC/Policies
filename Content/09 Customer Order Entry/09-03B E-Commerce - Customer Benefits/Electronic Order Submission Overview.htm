        <h1>Electronic Order Submission Overview</h1>
        <p>Some customers have the ability to generate an automated email either to notify the supplier that a new order is waiting on their site or to send the order to a predetermined email.&#160;These customers normally require their suppliers have a centralized order processing center with one email address for all of their <b>ship-to locations</b>.&#160;In some cases, we can set up a unique email for each <b>ship-to location</b>.</p>
