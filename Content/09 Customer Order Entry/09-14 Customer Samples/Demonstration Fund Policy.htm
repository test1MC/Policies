        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>All demonstrations should be processed in the home store of the customer or the location that will benefit. </li>
            <li>Demonstrations are for customers who have a valid Sherwin-Williams cash or charge account number.&#160; Demonstrations for walk-in customers are not allowed.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is for <b>GOM Paint</b> and <b>GOM Brushe</b>s, including <b>Purdy</b>, that will be supported by paint sales profits.&#160; The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is not to be used for additional products required to do the demonstration, such as: drywall, nails, wood, etc.&#160; Additional items are considered store expenses.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> can be used for purchasing competitors’ paint products to compare to <b>GOM paint products</b>.</li>
            <li>Unused drawdowns must also be recycled in the <b>PaintCare bin</b> and recorded on the <b>PaintCare Mistint and Drawdowns Recycling log</b>. Please refer to section <MadCap:xref href="../../17 External Compliance/17-01 PaintCare Recovery/PaintCare Recovery Program Overview.htm">PaintCare Recovery Program Overview</MadCap:xref> for more information on <b>Mistint and Drawdown Handling</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is not to be used to release, test, or demonstrate merchandise to employees. Store expense merchandise must be used for employee demonstrations or tests.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is not to be used for donations, mistints, complaint settlement, obsolete, or damaged products.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is not to be used for spray equipment demonstrations.&#160; For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../16 Spray Equipment/16-02 Spray Equipment/Spray Equipment Demonstration Policy.htm">Spray Equipment Demonstration Policy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>A second demonstration is acceptable only if the first was unsuccessful or the demonstration is given to a wider audience with different participants.&#160; </li>
            <li>Samples cannot be <b>IST</b>'d from one store to another if the <b>Demonstration Fund</b> is depleted.</li>
            <li>Districts will lose their demonstration credit if they attempt to move demonstration funds from one store to another.</li>
            <li>All demonstration products on a <b>Customer Order</b> must remain on a separate order than products that are not marked for demonstration.&#160; This means that two separate picking tickets may be needed. </li>
            <li>Districts using <b>Test Drive Program</b>:&#160; All <b>Demonstration Customer Orders</b> with the exception of drawdowns must be approved by the <b>District Manager</b> via email.&#160; Retain approval with order paperwork in batching.</li>
            <li>Districts using <b>Test Drive Program</b>:&#160; While the <b>Demonstration Fund</b> may be used with DM approval, it is recommended to use <b>Test Drive</b> rather than <b>Demonstration Fund</b> in particular situations, such as: drawdowns, customer refuses to pay for <b>Test Drive</b>, and large investment conversions for property management and home builders.</li>
            <li>All demonstrations must be processed through the <b>Demonstration Order Option</b> in <b>Customer Order Entry</b>.</li>
            <li>The <b>Demonstration Customer Order</b> (with the exception of drawdowns) must be signed by the customer. If delivered, the signature on the <b>Confirmation of Delivery</b> will suffice.&#160; If not, print a copy of the order and have the customer sign it. This copy must be retained and filed appropriately.</li>
