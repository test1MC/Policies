        <h1>Retint Transfer Order Procedure</h1>
        <p>If an order needs to be re-tinted at the <b>Service Center/Tint Facility</b> select option <b>Transfer Order</b> from the <b>Order Entry Menu</b> to transfer the order back to the <b>Service Center/Tint Facility</b> from which it was originally filled. You can transfer orders which have been sold or closed.&#160; This is critical as the color information will be updated on the order to keep an accurate record of the customer's color history, but the order cannot be transferred to a different location. Before transferring the order back to <b>Service Center/Tint Facility</b>, include a note in the <b>Special Instructions</b> of the <b>Customer Order</b> notifying the location of what actions are required for what product(s). </p>
