        <h1>PunchOut Company Benefits Overview</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Increased selling opportunity, customer acquisition, and retention</b>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>The website includes expansive decision support and content to help drive incremental purchase and trade-up options. It provides a better experience for customers, which increases their loyalty.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Complete control over marketing and merchandising</b>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Since customers “punch out” to <b>Sherwin-Williams.com</b>, this is a new opportunity to market to national accounts and to drive revenue. We decide which products to feature and how to talk about them. This also simplifies custom catalog production and updating.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Increased accuracy and efficiency</b>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>Electronic ordering/order receipt and invoicing minimize manual labor and potential for human error. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
