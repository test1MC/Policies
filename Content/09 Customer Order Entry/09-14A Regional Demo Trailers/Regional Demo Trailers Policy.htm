        <h1>Regional Demo Trailers Policy</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>
                <p>A specific <b>Demo Trailer</b> cost center must be established by <b>PCG Financial Accounting</b>. (No Demo Trailer inventory or expense can be charged to a Region cost center).</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Regional Demo Trailers</b> must remain fully stocked and maintained properly on a regular basis (such as running the trailer in order to turn the product daily to prevent it from going bad). Failure to do so could result in branches incurring a larger than normal expense all at once.</li>
            <li>An <b>eExpense</b> request must be submitted through <b>eAccounting</b> in order to establish the initial inventory that will be located in the trailer at any given time.</li>
            <li>A subsequent <b>eExpense</b> request should be submitted if any changes (&gt;$500) are made to the trailer’s inventory. For example, if a new product is being introduced or the amount of inventory is increasing/decreasing, a new <b>eExpense</b> should be submitted for approval.</li>
            <li>If existing materials’ quantities are increasing or new materials are added to the trailer’s inventory and an <b>eExpense</b> has been fully approved, the branch that is supplying the merchandise is responsible for the following actions:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Notifying <b>PCG Financial Accounting</b> that an expense to <b>prime sub 7599211</b> has been processed for the new material</li>
                <li>Faxing the expense transaction to (216)586-1800</li>
                <li>Writing the <b>Regional Cost Center</b> to expense at the top of the store expense transaction before faxing.&#160; Accounting will manually move the expense to the appropriate cost center. This is the only time the regional demo trailer cost center will incur an expense for material</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Spray guns and equipment are not to be expensed to the regional demo trailer cost center. If a new spray gun/equipment is required, the expense will be incurred by the <b>Tech Rep</b> using the gun/equipment. It will then be the responsibility of the <b>Tech Rep</b> to properly care for this spray gun/equipment.&#160; </li>
        </ol>
