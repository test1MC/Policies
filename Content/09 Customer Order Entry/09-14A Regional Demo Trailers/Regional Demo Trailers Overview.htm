        <h1>Regional Demo Trailers Overview</h1>
        <p>Mobile demonstration trailers help provide customers the opportunity to see and experience our products in a transportable environment. The trailers are owned by the region and are shared amongst the branches.</p>
        <p>While in possession of a demonstration trailer, branches are responsible for the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensuring the trailer has the <b>Regional Demo Trailer Inventory Form</b>, found in the <b>Forms Repository</b>, at all times.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Comparing the on-hand inventory against the <b>Regional Demo Trailer Inventory Form</b> after each use.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Replenishing any inventory that is used during demonstrations by processing a store expense via the <b>POS</b> to prime sub 7599211 (Mobile Trailer Demo Expense) at the branch level. Do not process an <b>IBAR</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Replacing any missing, obsolete, or bad material inventory. If the trailer arrives at a branch with bad material, the branch that had the trailer last in their possession is responsible for the replacement of the material. The expense will not be incurred at the regional level under any circumstances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Before taking possession of the trailer from another branch, the inventory should be reviewed with the current branch in possession to ensure the material was replenished appropriately.</p>
        <p>Any additional replenishment material needed should be coordinated by the current branch with the previous branch via an ISR/IST. The material must be received/expensed by the previous branch (see prime sub above).</p>
