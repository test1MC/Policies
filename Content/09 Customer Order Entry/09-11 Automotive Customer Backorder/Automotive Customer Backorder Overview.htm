        <h1>Automotive Customer Backorder  Overview</h1>
        <p>All Branches will use one consistent method to track and fill back-orders for our Customers, and maximize sales. Benefits of the <b>Backorder</b> process include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows partial shipments for an order which might have products on backorder.</li>
            <li>Allows the user to bill the amount of material which was shipped.</li>
            <li>Allows the user to bill customer order entry lines without having to make the entire order "ready-for-delivery."</li>
            <li>Enables a <b>Bill of Lading</b> to be created directly from the delivery screen without having to go into the <b>Bill of Lading menu</b> to produce the document.</li>
            <li>The <b>Confirmation of Delivery Ticket</b> will now show the “order” quantity and the “ship” quantity. This will let the Customer know that the order was received correctly.</li>
            <li>When the backorder is received by the Branch, the original order details including <b>Purchase Order</b> number (if any), original quantity, amount previously shipped, and original pricing will all be contained in a <b>Customer Order Entry</b> in <b>POS</b>.</li>
            <li>Provides uniform process for tracking and fulfillment of back-orders.</li>
            <li>Provides reporting tool – <b>Daily Customer Service Report</b> - to measure fill rate by dollars and units.</li>
        </ul>
