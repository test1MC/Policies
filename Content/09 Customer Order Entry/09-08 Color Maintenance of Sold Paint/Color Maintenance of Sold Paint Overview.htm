        <h1>Color Maintenance of Sold Paint Overview</h1>
        <p>Customers occasionally bring already purchased product back into the store for color maintenance.&#160; If the customer wishes to leave the paint and return later, record the movement of the inventory into the store and provide the customer with a record of their request. Products are not to be returned and brought back into inventory as this can re-age invoices, mis-state sales, and improperly warehouses the product.</p>
