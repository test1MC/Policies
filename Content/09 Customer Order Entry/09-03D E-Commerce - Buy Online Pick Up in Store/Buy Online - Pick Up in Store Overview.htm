        <h1>Buy Online - Pick Up in Store Overview</h1>
        <p><b>Buy Online - Pick Up in Store</b> allows our customers with online profiles linked to their in-store account to place orders online at <b>Sherwin-Williams.com</b> and pick up prepared orders in the store. Not all customers are able to place their orders online- these customers will be prompted to call their home store for more information.&#160; </p>
        <p>Be aware of the situations that may prevent your customers from purchasing online and what steps may be taken to remedy the situation:</p>

        <p>Customers placing orders online have access to the Sherwin-Williams’ catalog of products as well as the vendor products we stock; products requiring special order, some regional products and local buys may not be available.&#160;To help make selection of the right products easier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">The online site takes into consideration all regulatory restrictions which may affect what products are available for purchase in the customer’s area. However, it will not prevent customers who may be restricted from ordering products for other reasons from placing the order.&#160;<b>POS</b> will either prevent you from  selling or provide notification of purchasing requirements which should be validated before the sale is completed.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Customers are provided information to help them select a convenient store location with stock availability.&#160;Customers will not see your available inventory but will be provided with information on what may be available:</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If an order needs to be fulfilled by multiple Sherwin-Williams locations, <b>Buy Online - Pick Up in Store</b> allows the customer to split the order between stores – you only see the order information for your location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customers provide payment information online and stores use this information to process the sale in the store.&#160; Customers are limited to <b>SW Charge</b> and <b>Credit Cards</b> as forms of payment and multiple forms of payment are not permitted.</p>
        <p>Orders placed online will take about thirty (30) minutes to arrive in the <b>POS</b>.&#160; However, if a customer calls in with a question on an order they have submitted to your store, you can check your email to reference a copy of the order confirmation immediately.</p>
        <p>Sherwin-Williams sends order updates by email to customers who have placed orders online (some of these emails will be triggered by actions you take with the order in the store).&#160; It is important to follow the <b>POS</b> process correctly so that we can keep our customers informed on their order status.&#160; Below are copies of the emails received by customers throughout the process and the activity that generates the email.&#160; If a customer contacts you with a question about an email they have received, use these examples as a reference in understanding where the customer is in the process and how to advise them.</p>
