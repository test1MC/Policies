When it is ready, the amber light will remain on steady and the green light will flash slowly. Turn on your <b>AML scanner</b> and it should connect. If it does not connect within two minutes, call the <b>Help Desk</b>. </p>
                        <p>Once it is connected, try doing some <b>cycle counts</b> in the farther areas of the store to make sure it is communicating properly. If everything is working properly, peel off the back of the <b>mounting tape</b> on the back of the bracket on the <b>Motorola access point</b> and mount it up as high as possible. </p>
