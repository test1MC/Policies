        <h1>Transfer Spray Source Repair Order Procedure</h1>
        <h2>This section does not apply to Automotive or&#160;Product Finishes.</h2>
        <p>Complete this step ONLY after you have created the <b>customer order</b> for repair.&#160;Be aware that once the order has been transferred, the originating store may no longer make changes to the order.&#160;The repair location will complete the repair, adding information for labor charges, warranty information, and parts to the <b>customer order</b>.&#160;An <b>ISR</b> is automatically created on the originating store’s system when a transfer is performed.&#160; The repair location will handle the sale of the <b>repair order</b>.&#160; When the order is sold, the originating store's <b>customer order</b> will be automatically closed and the <b>ISR</b> will be automatically canceled.&#160;The repair location will ship the repaired equipment back to either the customer or the originating store if it is not being picked up by the customer at the repair location.</p>
