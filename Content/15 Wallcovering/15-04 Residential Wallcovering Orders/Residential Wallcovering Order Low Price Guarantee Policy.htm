        <p>Sherwin-Williams will meet any competitor’s price on <b>wallcovering</b> under the following conditions:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>The <b>Low Price Guarantee</b> applies to retail sales only.</li>
            <li>The <b>Wallcovering</b> purchase must be the same quality, manufacturer, pattern number, and quantity as quoted by the competitor. </li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>The <b>Low Price Guarantee</b> does not include <b>54 vinyl wallcovering</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Prices matched must be for products sold under normal selling conditions. Clearance ads or closeouts sold by a competitor do not apply. </li>
            <li>The <b>Low Price Guarantee</b> applies to product only and does not apply to shipping costs. Sales tax must be charged on all purchases, if applicable.</li>
            <li>Sherwin-Williams must be able to verify the <b>price quote</b>. This can be accomplished by:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
                <li>Comparing prices in a printed ad.</li>
                <li>Comparing prices on a <b>written price quote</b> provided by the customer (quote must be on letterhead of competitor).</li>
                <li>Calling the actual competitor by phone and requesting their prices on the same product with the same quantity.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>If you are unable to verify competitor pricing at the time of sale, you must sell the product at our current price. Verify competitor pricing within thirty (30) days of the customer’s final sale invoice date and&#160; follow the procedure to refund the difference to the customer.</li>
            <li>If a competitor lowers their price on a <b>wallcovering</b> product(s) purchased at a Sherwin-Williams store for a higher price, you may refund or credit the customer the price difference.</li>
            <li>There is a chance that on occasion you may be forced to sell below your store cost to match a competitor. If the customer is a retail customer, and the product is an exact match with the exact same quantity you must match the price in spite of the margin. In this situation:</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>Before ordering product at room lot costs, verify with <b>SWAT</b> that the patterns are not part of our stocking assortments available at better <b>EDI</b> costs.</li>
                <li>When ordering the product, you might also want to contact your <b>local vendor rep</b> to see if they can cut your cost. However, there is no guarantee that this will happen.<br /></li>
            </ol>
