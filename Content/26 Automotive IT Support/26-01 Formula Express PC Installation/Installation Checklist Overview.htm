        <p><b>RECYCLE</b>: Once you are comfortable with your new PC setup, you can use the two boxes that the equipment was sent in to return your old <b>Formula Express</b> computer, fax printer, monitor, mouse, and keyboard equipment for recycling. A <b>return label</b> should have been included. If the box is not big enough for the equipment that must be recycled, please contact the <b>POS Help Desk</b> at 1-216-566-2740 to arrange additional boxes</p>
